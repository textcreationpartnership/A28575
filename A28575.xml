            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADVICE OF THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL, Which may ſerve as a Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I liſt to paſſe here but as a bare Tranſlator of <hi>Anaxanders</hi> Loves, &amp; <hi>Alcidaris</hi> Adventures, and to make my ſelf more recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thee, ſeek my authority from the Arabians and Indians; I aſſure my ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:56329:3"/>Reader, thou wilt be hardly perſwaded that this Hiſtory is true. However it be, ſeeing my aim is but to pleaſe thee, and with pleaſure to divert thee, I care not much whether thou read my Book as a Hiſtory or Fable, ſo it do content thee. If I did love to ſay much, I would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, that there are in thoſe brave Romances which are after the nature of Epique Poems, inſtructions fit for all States, that vice may be abhorred, and vertue cheriſh'd, as well as in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and, in Romances, ſo much the more, as he that writes them propoſes ever perfection to himſelf, and ſets thoſe vertues in a more eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, whereof examples are preſented us by Hiſtories. Beſides, there are but few Hiſtories, which do not either lie or flatter, as they forget troubleſome truths, they publiſh lies that do oblige, and commonly diſcover other mens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
<pb facs="tcp:56329:3"/>to comply with ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious minds, and ſacrifize to envy: But the compoſers of Epique Poems, and Romances, are exempt from that black malice and moſt baſe complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. They deſcribe things not as they are, but as they ought to be; Tis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intereſt, that they condemn foul deeds, and Treaſons, and that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Juſtice, Wiſdome, and Valor. They make the guilty bluſh in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as well as true Hiſtorians, and can tell better how, than they, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate mens hearts in the defence of right, and reaſon, even to the laſt breath of life. Beſides, that their deſign is but to be acceptable, and ſtir up divers paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Readers, they inſtruct them nevertheleſs and edifie them, ſo as after reading them, they grow much greater friends to vertue than before. As for my ſelf, who cannot brag of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive,
<pb facs="tcp:56329:4"/>moving gifts, I boaſt at leſt, to come thus neer a true Hiſtory, that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the juſtneſs of times, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe exactly the Situation of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Regions, and that I relate the cuſtoms and ceremonies of the people, at leaſt of ſuch as may give any pleaſure to the Readers, eſtranging my ſelf from ſuch things as may be harſh to their minds, or trouble them. As many as have been in the eaſtern voyage, &amp; ſeen the <hi>Mogul's</hi> Court, who is call'd, great <hi>Achebar,</hi> of his Subjects, know that of all <hi>Aſia</hi> they are the beſt men on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back that they are great makers of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouzels, but that at their publick feaſts they moſtly uſe the ſports of Fencing. Thoſe who have ſeen, as well as thoſe that have deſcribed the Kingdom of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> agree all of them, that duels are more uſed there than in any part of the world; that in times paſt they have
<pb facs="tcp:56329:4"/>been condemn'd, and the duelliſts grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly puniſhed, but that of late years, they were fain to ſuffer them, hoping by that means to aboliſh them. What I have ſaid of the nuptials and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Princes, is confirmed likewiſe by divers as well antient as modern Hiſtorians; So as (Reader) it reſts only that I ſatisfie thee of the time, amnd true race of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> from whom I make <hi>Anaxander</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.</p>
            <p>Thou ſhalt know then, (if thou pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to believe what <hi>Albacen</hi> an Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian Hiſtorian ſays, who liv'd in <hi>Tamberlains</hi> time, and who in two different Volumes hath writ his two childrens lives) that after the death of that great Captain, who was the Prince of <hi>Zaguetays</hi> ſon, all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which were of a great extent, were divided between the two children <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tochio,</hi>

            <p>BEing not able to wait on you according to my promiſe, when you went from hence; I believe, I ſhall not do you injury, if I commend you better company. Tis that book I ſend you, which you heard ſo much prais'd, and which, you thought to carry with you into thoſe parts, for a comfort in your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from the Court. It is certainly worth your eſtimation, and as great impatience, as I knew you did expect it with. And, if in times paſt, the belly of a Queen from whence a Prince was to be born, us'd to be crown'd, I wonder not, that you, before the birth thereof approv'd it. 'Twill without doubt, relliſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain your palate, which thoſe ill lines of mine, you have ſometimes made me ſend you, have much diſtaſted.

I will not conceal my weakneſſe: I knew I ſaw the picture of a feigned thing, and yet I felt as violent motions, as the thing real would have ſtirred in me, if it had been true, and that I had beheld it with mine own eyes. sometimes I was ſorry, and ſometimes glad, as <hi>Monſieur de Boys-Robert</hi> was pleas'd to tell me, of good or ill fortune: me though, I was in earneſt intereſted in the affairs of his imaginary Kings; I had many fears for poor

               <p>As ſoon as the ſad knowledge of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontus</hi> death, arrived at <hi>Baticalus,</hi> where the King but late retired, to enjoy the fruits of <hi>Liſimantus Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie,</hi> who had regained from his Enemies the Countrey of <hi>Canara;</hi> As ſoon, I ſay, as that ſad noiſe had run through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, all Sports and Paſſe-times ceaſt, and their triumphant Tunes were chang'd to woefull
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56329:10"/>Moanes, and the unlook'd-for mourning which the Court put on, ſpred ſuddainly thorowout the Kingdome of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> which, in that youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prince, had loft the flower of all their hopes.</p>
               <p>This ſorrow was ſo univerſall, and this loſs ſo generally felt, that any man ſeem'd guilty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tears, and none did dare, although in publick, to keep in his ſorrow, for fear of being judg'd perſidious, or a Traytor.</p>
               <p>But the fair <hi>Orazia,</hi> more than all, with grief unſpeakable, receiv'd the knowledge of that loſs; and though her ſelf obtain'd thereby three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, ſhe could not yet endure the everlaſting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration from that only brother whom ſhe ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly had loved, and of whoſe dear regards of her, ſhe had ſo great aſſurances; Her beauteous mouth, which through exceſs of love, had cauſed all the world to ſigh, ſigh'd now its ſelf through her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of ſorrow; her lovely eyes, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were call'd the living Fountains of the Graces, and of Loves, were now, but laſting ſprings of ever-flowing tears. And though ſhe ſtrove her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to deſtroy that beauty, by the clouds ſhe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt upon them, yet did they not forbear to ſend their beams abroad, and ſhine with equall force, as does the Sun, ſometimes betwixt two ſhowers.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs <hi>Liſimena,</hi> whoſe ſociety, but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was ſo ſweet, and acceptable to her, and in whoſe boſome ſhe was wont to lock in ſafety, her diſpleaſures, and delights, grew now uncapable of ſerving her with any conſolation, nay, to ſpeak truth, her ſelf much needed it.</p>

                     </gap>ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> had drawn into thoſe parts, ſhar'd greatly in the common ſorrow of the Kingdome, which was then her ſanctuary, and ſeem'd as much afflicted, as if her Father had been ſpoyl'd of all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; whom formne, and the valour of <hi>Liſiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> had made victorious over the King of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dives,</hi> and who had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now, as ſhe never fail'd from alwayes being with <hi>Orazia,</hi> to aſſiſt in the contrivances of new Paſtimes, far was it from her thoughts, to leave her in the woefull caſe, whereto this new miſ-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had reduced her: But how was their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment now altered from thier former conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation? for, whereas they were wont to breath, no other thing, than ſweetneſs, and content, they now could nothing elſe but mix confuſedly their tears, and ſighs, not able to ſpeak a word.</p>
               <p>Thus, in embraces they were found, when <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin, Arontus</hi> faithfull ſquire, with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance bearing deaths picture in it, entred the Princeſs Chamber, and kneeling, ſaid, Madam, behold the firſt time, ever I unwillingly obſerv'd my Maſters commands; and ſurely I obey him now in this laſt ſervice, in duty to a ſorrowfull Commiſſion: and ſaying this, he from his pocket

               <p>The fair <hi>Orazia,</hi> who had not need of this addition to her ſorrow, had notwithſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution enough to open the letter, which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the faithfull ſquire: But yet her tears which choak'd her eyes, gave her not leave ſo ſoon to ſee that it contain'd theſe words.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This letter did redouble her affliction, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the violent touches of her ſorrow, waked her amourous diſlurbances. After ſhe had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times accuſed the heavens, and curs'd <hi>Aron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> fatall victory, which coſt his life; comming at length, to caſt her eyes upon the notice he had given her in his Letter, (admire the force and power of love) a ſuddain alteration ſurpriſed her, and mov'd her thoughts from the ſad mourning of her brother, to reflect upon her Lover. She alwayes had opinion, that <hi>Ariomant,</hi> whoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo Kingly, muſt be of eminent quality; and notwithſtanding his ſo humble faſhion in the King her Fathers Court, ſhe knew, that in his eyes and Courage, there was ſomewhat great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
               <p>But at that inſtant, ſhe receiv'd ſo glorious a teſtimony of his birth, ſhe neither could diſguiſe apprehenſion, nor diſſemble from <hi>Liſimenaes</hi> eyes, the paſſion ſhe was in, to be more fully ſatisfied; For which cauſe, drawing <hi>Saradin</hi> apart, My friend (ſaid ſhe) to him, ſince the misfortune hapned to us by thy Maſters loſs, hat teſtimony hath <hi>Ariamont</hi> given, who now commands the Army: Madam, anſwered <hi>Saradin,</hi> ſince that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day, where in the Prince, forced to leave us, gave him the guidance of our Troops, he hath ſo worthily diſcharg'd himſelf, that though he be a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56329:12"/>ſtranger, and known by nothing but his actions, he hath not purchaſed the ſmalleſt jealouſie; all our Captains, with delight obey him, and though the Prince had not himſelf appointed him as chief, I think he had been choſen by the Armies generall conſent. His wiſdom and his valour are ſo met, and ſo full of every vertue ſit to make up a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, that if there be any thing, which may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter a comfort to us, in this dire miſchance, it is, to ſee our Prince his power hath fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo noble hands.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs receiv'd a two-fold mitigation of her ſorrow, when ſhe learnt that he, to whom ſhe had already given her heart, not knowing his deſcent, was not alone a Prince by birth, but that his reputation was ſo great, and univerſally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by all the King her Fathers ſubjects, as that ſhe ſaw fair likely-hoods, of good ſucceſs unto her loves.</p>
               <p>The only curioſity ſhe had to know his paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and over what people he commanded, did yet keep her unſatisfied; and gathering by <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dins</hi> diſcourſe, that in the Army, he was not held for what he was, ſhe gueſt there was ſome reaſon, why he publiſh'd not himſelf, and that ſhe could not know the truth thereof, except himſelf did tell it her.</p>
               <p>This was the reaſon why, among ſo many other queſtions ask'd of <hi>Saradin,</hi> ſhe enquired of him, whether his return would not be ſhortly. Madam, anſwered the faithfull ſquire, as ſoon as he ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56329:13"/>revolted ſlaves, whom we have puniſhed, and overthrown in battell, he will bring back the victorious army, which as you know have decreed ſacred honours to my Maſter, whoſe pretious body embalmed, will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few dayes conducted hither, drawn in a triumphant Chariot, which ſhall accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his pompous funerals. It cannot be long ere they returne; for the <hi>Decanians</hi> ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with joy to be delivered from two ſlaves, who have driven out all their blood Royall from their government, came every day to yeeld themſelves unto the valiant <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riomant,</hi> and bring him ſtill their City keyes, and Caſtles likewiſe. And that poor people, incapable of defending themſelves, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure rank them under the Kings dominion, whoſe clemency they know, as ſurely as his juſtice.</p>
               <p>The fair <hi>Orazia</hi> not able at that time to learn more newes, of her deer <hi>Ariomant,</hi> with much impatience look'd for his return, and ſtill ſhe ſought her common comforts from <hi>Liſimena,</hi> from whom ſhe could not hide the new occaſions of her joy, nor yet conceal her Lovers birth, which from her Brothers Letter (which the Gods would not allow an end to,) ſhe began to know; But ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd her, ſhe ſhould keep it ſecret, and make no mention of it till a fitter ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Mean while, for her diverſions, and to beguile the time of <hi>Ariomants</hi> abſence, ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten talked with <hi>Saradin,</hi> and made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56329:13"/>the prayſes, which ſhe already had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, with ſo much content in his behalf, whom more than all the world ſhe lov'd. And becauſe ſhe would make <hi>Saradin</hi> entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hers, whoſe faithfulneſſe ſhe knew unpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llel'd, her chief ſquire being ſlain in the battell, ſhe choſe <hi>Saradin</hi> to ſucceed him, to which, ſhe got the King her Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who was much pleas'd to give him that reward, as worthy of his long good ſervices.</p>
               <p>If hitherto, I have not ſpoken of that great Monarchs ſorrow, and exceſſive grief, for loſſe of his dear ſon, upon whoſe magnanimity, and valour, he had built his reſt, and hopes, 'tis to ſpeak truly, that I hold his woes unſpeakable; Beſides, in telling you the little ſtrength he had to meet that unexpected newes, and the deſpair which more than once had tempted him to do violence on himſelf, I fear to lay a blemiſh on the other actions of his life. Let us forget his ſorrows, and his over-paſſion then, and call to mind the conſtancy wherewith he ſhortly after arm'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and reſolution which he took, to honour, (as his army had deſir'd) his deer <hi>Arontus</hi> memory, and funerals.</p>
               <p>He alwayes kept the brave <hi>Liſimantus</hi> with him, and ſo much valued the courage of that invincible Knight, as that he dar'd not in his preſence ſhew his great reſentments; and truly 'twas from him, he had more comfort than from any other, being a man, who had deſpis'd a thouſand deaths; and one, who though his life
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56329:14"/>were glorious for a thouſand brave exploits, yet found no ſweetneſs in it, for the bloody diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments he each day received in the ſcorn of beautious <hi>Liſimena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whiles accommodations are preparing to ſolemnize the funerall pomps of that Prince whom they expect, and whoſe body, glorious though without a ſoul, craves the honour of a triumph, 'tis requiſite, that by the way, I tell you ſomewhat of this <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> who for his vertue, merits in this place, to have a ſhort abridgement of his life recorded.</p>
               <p>He was a Souldier under fortunes banner, who from his infancy being given a Page unto the Princeſs <hi>Liſimena,</hi> and after given again unto the King of <hi>Zeilan</hi> her father, as you ſhal ſee in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell of this ſtory, from ſtep to ſtep advanc'd him by his courage, and by his excellent conduct roſe to the greateſt charges in the Kingdom; and ſo far forth, as after <hi>Arbiran</hi>'s death, he followed him, and was made generall of that great Army, which hath of late triumphed over the King of <hi>Maldives.</hi> All the Indian Chronicles are full of memorable actions, by him done in that long war; and you ſhall by and by learn from his own mouth, the reaſon why, to take upon him the name of <hi>Liſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus,</hi> he forſook his own, a name he borrowed from the King his Maſters only daughter, to whom from his firſt riſing he was bold to ſend ſighs, and amorous aſpects.</p>
               <p>The fair <hi>Liſimena</hi> (ſo was the Princeſs cald,) beſides a private inclination which ſhe had to cheriſh that accompliſht Knight, for his own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56329:14"/>ſake, did yet beſides account her ſelf oblig'd thereto, for great and noted ſervices, which every day he did unto the Crown of <hi>Zeilan,</hi> whoſe chief ſupport, and prop he was: but the great courage of her heart, and honour, which ſhe valued more than all things elſe, cauſed her to undervalue in her thoughts, the ſecret love of that unknown young man, whom ſhe had ſeen to come ſo poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted to the King her Fathers Court, who knew no more than ſhe, his birth, and could not enough wonder at the boldneſs which he took, not only to ſend forth his looks towards her, but even to ſigh in preſence of her, whiles the whole Court ſaw and knew it; becauſe it was a Law throughout the <hi>Indes,</hi> that a Princeſs could not marry but her equall, nor without much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſuffer the addreſſes of a man, who were not Kingly born. And in ſome parts the Law was more ſevere than others, as in the Kingdome of <hi>Decan,</hi> where death was added to the ſhame of that Princeſs, who ſhould unequally diſpoſe her ſelf. Which is at preſent yet the Cuſtom among the <hi>Negres</hi> as well of the Kingdome of <hi>Cambaye,</hi> as <hi>Calecut,</hi> and all the parts of <hi>Malabar.</hi> Not one however dar'd to ſpeak his thoughts of <hi>Liſimantus</hi> open love, envy it ſelf was ſilent, as well for that they knew the greatneſs of his humour, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which they were bound to owe the power of his command, wherein he did ſo worthily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf.</p>
               <p>The King obſerved him as well as others, but that his wiſdome did oblige him to diſtemble what he ſaw, becauſe in truth he was very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56329:15"/>as the chiefeſt inſtrument of that revenge he had ordained for his greateſt enemy, the King of <hi>Maldives,</hi> who had for wantonneſſe aſſaulted him, and ſworn his ruin; But for fear of cauſing greater paſſion which he daily ſaw to grow in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimantus,</hi> it ſeem'd him beſt to ſeparate his daughter for ſome time, and ſend her to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Law, and friend, the King of <hi>Narſingus</hi> Court, to keep her Couſin <hi>Orazia</hi> company. He wanted not a colour for this act, for they had lately underſtood by an intelligencer, that the King of <hi>Maldives</hi> who was then lately beaten in two ſea fights by <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> made great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to beſiege the City of <hi>Colombo,</hi> where the King of <hi>Zeilan</hi> commonly held his Court, and he conceiv'd he ſhould have leſſe cauſe to fear, when as his daughter who was the greateſt treaſure that he had, (though in his Countries <hi>Pearl,</hi> and <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds</hi> &amp; <hi>Saphires</hi> are found aboundantly) ſhould remain in ſafety.</p>
               <p>This reſolution he no ſooner took but put in execution, and ſent his only daughter (who long ſince loſt her Mother) to <hi>Narſinga,</hi> with an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page which well became her greatneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liſimantus</hi> would moſt gladly have diverted that voyage, had he dared, and had oppoſed his courage to the Kings fear, if that he ſhould not have too openly declared himſelf, and with inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency abuſed the proſperity of his fortune and his Armes; this made him hide his diſcontent, and yeelding to neceſſity, permitted her to go away, who had fomented ſtill his courage, and was cauſe of all the goodly actions he had done.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56329:15"/>
               <p>It was indeed the King of <hi>Maldives</hi> project, to beſiege the City of <hi>Colombo,</hi> that in ſome ſort he might repair his ſeverall aſſronts, receiv'd in many Sea fights: But by the impatient courage of <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> he was prevented, who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they were ſlow in comming, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how the King his Maſters Forces were augmented by the late ayd ſent by the King of <hi>Narſinga</hi> his Brother in Law, thought ſit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the enemy, and go lay battery to <hi>Bandos,</hi> his chiefeſt fortreſſe, which was not far from the Iſle of <hi>Male,</hi> where then he made his war-like proviſions. And that which put him upon the enterprize, was, that he had intelligence within the place; he propoſed it to the councill of warre, who approv'd thereof, and was ſo happy, as his plot ſucceeded for the King his Maſters advantage; he took that Caſtle under the King of <hi>Maldives</hi> noſe, who was come to ſuccour it, ſunck divers of his great ſhips, and in a word, to finiſh all his victories, he defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abſolutely the King of <hi>Maldives,</hi> who fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fartheſt parts of the Iſles of <hi>Palandurus;</hi> he got all his Countries, wherewith he enlarged his Maſters, and did ſuch notable things, and worthy of admiration, as will never be forgotten, as you ſhall more at large perceive in the fifth Book of this Hiſtory; for I mean now to tell you only, what adventures brought him to the City of <hi>Baticalus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No ſooner was he return'd victorious into the Iſland of <hi>Zeilan,</hi> but the King had notice, that the two revolted ſlaves, the faithleſſe <hi>Rozalcan</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56329:16"/>and his Brother <hi>Zabain,</hi> who had uſurp'd the Kingdome of <hi>Decan,</hi> and driven out of all their lawfull Princes, not contented with the Signiories of thoſe twelve mighty Provinces, would yet aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelves, at the charges of the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> from whom, already they had taken the Country of <hi>Canara</hi> which bordered on them, and lay convenient for their purpoſe. As ſoon as the King of <hi>Zeilan</hi> knew hereof, having no more to fear now from the King of <hi>Maldives,</hi> whoſe pride was well abated, though nothing more than how to ſuccour and revenge his friend, his neighbour, and allie, the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> to whom he ſent back his Troops, adding as many of his own ſubjects, under the conduct of <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> whoſe ſervice by the ſame occaſion he preſented him, if in the preſent neceſſity of his affairs he thought him needfull.</p>
               <p>You may imagine if our <hi>Heros,</hi> who did ſeek but new occaſion, to employ his courage in, was very glad to find it in a place, where he was ſure to ſee the ſweeteſt object of his thoughts, he did not run, he flew unto it, and being arriv'd at <hi>Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagar,</hi> where then the King of <hi>Narſinga</hi> was, he had the honour to divide the Royall Army, with the Prince <hi>Arontus,</hi> only heir to thoſe great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, of <hi>Narſinga, Biſnagar,</hi> and of <hi>Orixa;</hi> But <hi>Arontus,</hi> as great reaſon was, did chooſe, and took the greateſt and the hardeſt task to undergo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liſimantus</hi> then, with thoſe Troops which he brought out of <hi>Zeilan,</hi> were ſent to re-obtain the Country of <hi>Canara</hi> from the enemies, and the Prince <hi>Arontus</hi> led his Army into the Kingdome
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56329:16"/>of <hi>Decan,</hi> reſolving to root out thoſe two ſlaves, which had revolted from their Prince, and caus'd ſo many, and ſo divers miſchiefs; he therein bore himſelf ſo bravely, that having met them in the field, and with the pride of all their Army, he gave them battail, he ſlew <hi>Zabain</hi> with his own hand, and aided by the valour of <hi>Ariomont</hi> and <hi>Calliſtenus,</hi> had ſo glorious a ſucceſs, as that he rooted out thoſe Monſters, of whom, the one as I have ſaid, with his own hand he ſlew; but from the other had his mortall wound, who was then preſently tane priſoner, &amp; by and by, ſhall ſerve to adorn the Funerall Triumph of that Prince, falln in his victory, and whom to ſorrow for, we begun already.</p>
               <p>Before thoſe paſſags in <hi>Decan, Liſimantus</hi> had already done ſo well his duty, as he regain'd the Province of <hi>Canara,</hi> ſo famous for thoſe three Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Onor, Mangalor,</hi> and <hi>Baticalus;</hi> and after he had put to death, or baniſht far enough from thence, all thoſe who had been conſtant to thoſe ſlaves, who faith-leſs had oppos'd themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his power, he ſent a poſt to give knowledge of it to the King of <hi>Narſinga;</hi> which when he underſtood, as well becauſe he would enjoy the fruits of that valiant Cavaliers victory, as for his neer being to <hi>Decan,</hi> and ſooner having advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from his Son, he left the great City of <hi>Biſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> &amp; removed his whole Court to <hi>Baticalus,</hi> wich heretofore had been the antient burying place of the firſt Kings of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> when they aboad in the Country of <hi>Canara,</hi> and ſhall ſerve ſhortly in the ſame ſtead unto the generous <hi>Arontus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56329:17"/>
               <p>There 'twas, that <hi>Liſimantus</hi> ſaw again the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt object of his paſſion, there 'twas that all his great deſires awaked, and where he thought, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving orecome his enemies, he ſhould obtain fair <hi>Liſimena;</hi> But, though that beautious Princeſs knew ſufficiently <hi>Liſimantus</hi> merits, and was not ignorant of one of all thoſe ſervices he did her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the evill reliſh of his petty birth, diverted her from loving him, and from his converſation too, for fear leſt thoſe perfections which ſhe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his mind and body, might at length gain on her, and light a fire, which was already kindling in her heart, which then ſhe might not know to quench.</p>
               <p>The fair <hi>Orazia</hi> knew all the ſecrets of her ſoul, as ſhe had likewiſe opened hers to <hi>Liſimena,</hi> and whiles each entertained other with their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous reſentments, there came a Poſt from the King of <hi>Zeilan,</hi> who crav'd again his daughter, and pray'd the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> to ſend her back, becauſe there was no ſtir or trouble now within his Countries: But this news greatly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Orazia,</hi> who was like to loſe, and may be, loſe for ever that deer Princeſs, unto whom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſo neer a bloud, ſo great and perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had united her. However, little was that ſorrow, to another which befell her ſhortly after, by the arivall of a Poſt come from <hi>Decan,</hi> who as I ſaid, brought her the wofull newes of her only brother, <hi>Arontus</hi> death. But, for we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mentioned the honours meant unto him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though dead, and the proviſions fitted for his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; Let us go on in our ſtory, and renew no
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56329:17"/>more, the plaints, and griefs, which but too oft already, I have for a loſſe ſo generall, repeated.</p>
               <p>Scarce had a Month been ſpent ſince that ſad news had entred <hi>Baticalus,</hi> when a Poſt from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riomant</hi> came to the King, to give him notice of his Victorious Armies coming home, which wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the glorious body of his Son: Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately that valiant King, forgetting or diſſembling his inward ſorrow, caus'd the ſtately ſumptuous Convoy to be fitted, which, by night, and with this ceremony, paſſed from the gate of the great ſtreet of <hi>Baticalus,</hi> to the Royal Palace.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the whole ſtreet was ſpread with black Velvet, and at each window burnt ſix Torches (throughout every ſtory) of Virgin wax, to ſhew the pomp of that Solemnity. All the Souldiers, who in that War had followed him, paſt File and File, in ſtreaming tears, trayling their Pikes upon the ground, as conquer'd people, rather than victorious; their brazen Drums in mourning caſes, beat but now, and then, and gave a certain doleful ſound, which mov'd new horror in the people; when as the Foot companies, (which were a great number,) had all paſſ'd by, the Cavalry in Sable Armes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, their horſe Capariſons of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, having the fights of their Helmets down, and holding but the ſhivers of Lances in their hands; their Trumpets, but half blown, ſent forth moſt lamentable ſounds or rather cries, which now made melt the hearts of thoſe, who formerly they had encouraged; next them, came <hi>Ariomant,</hi> who really afflicted, hid not his face,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56329:18"/>as did the reſt, but in his eyes would have them ſee the ſadneſs of his heart, and in this ſorrowful appearance he did ſeem ſo handſome, that <hi>Orazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a,</hi> who obſerv'd him paſſing by, was doubly (but for divers cauſes) moved, by his tears; <hi>

               <p>When all the Funeral ceremonies were ended, and the great ſorrow overpaſt, the King, who had a manlike heart, diverting by degrees his trouble, ſought comfort in the great perfections of his Daughter, which was left him, the rare <hi>Orarza,</hi> who, gaining every day, new charmes from the return her of deereſt Lover, grew a continual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of delight, to all that ſaw her; her beautious face, ſhining, within that great and obſcure Veil, had more force, than when the Sun burſts through the cloud, which in foul weather environ it:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56329:19"/>Love never leaves her eyes, in greateſt ſadneſs, nor in her ſtricteſt mourning do her graces ever quit her.</p>
               <p>Before the Kings departure from <hi>Baticalus,</hi> he made proviſion for diſorders in the Kingdom, and chiefly to reſtrain the liberty, of private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, which the War had lately very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd among his brave Nobility. Indeed, they gave too great a way, unto that brute, and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fury, and thereby too much wrong'd their courage, which exalted them above all other Nations far: For preventing therefore anew, the progreſſe of this miſchief, which from day to day got ſtrength, the Councill was aſſembled, and the King ordained a Law ſevere, whereby, without exception, of or rank, or quality whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it was decree'd, that the infringers ſhould unpardonably paſſe the Hangmans hands, and have their heads ſtruck off, beſides the loſſe of offices, and goods, which ſhould remain confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the King, and that the execution might be ſure, and that all hope of favour for the future might be clean taken away, his Majeſty ſwore ſolemnly, before the Altars, on the ſacred Books, and by his Fathers ſoul, to make due execution of it; nor that his Son, if yet alive, ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the Law, if he ſhould give himſelf to that inhumane courſe, and thereby run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of it.</p>
               <p>This ſtrict Ordinance, repreſſ'd exceedingly the fierceneſs of that ready youth, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to hide their often reſentments after inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries received, and reſtrained their too too heady
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56329:19"/>forwardneſs, wherein, ſo indiſcreetly they had laid the chiefeſt point of honor. When as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proviſion had been made for this diſorder, and, that the King, had, for the good, and quiet of his people, ſettled other wholſome Laws, and ſtrengthned all the Holds of <hi>Canara,</hi> with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Governors, and meet proviſions, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all manner of Carriages, and Wagons to be ready, for that within eight daies, he would depart from <hi>Baticalus;</hi> and for more acceptation to the King of <hi>Zeylan,</hi> who deſir'd his Daughter, he meant to wait on her himſelf unto the neereſt Port for her conveniency, with which advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he bid the Poſt return unto the King his Maſter.</p>
               <p>This reſolution of the Kings, pleaſed greatly <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> who being to be chief of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct meaned to declare himſelf upon the way, and let <hi>Liſimena</hi> know, (who ſaw too much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) his great paſſion ſo her love.

                  <hi>Orazia,</hi> who but lately had the ſame reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for her <hi>Ariomant,</hi> whilſt his condition was unknown unto her, and who knew that Love does not conſider qualities; or ſet a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween parties, was in as much trouble as <hi>Liſimena,</hi> to flatter her paſſion without offending her, or herſelf; for her own ends, forbad her to adviſe for a <hi>Liſimenaes</hi> dvantage, in the impatient and extream deſire ſhe had, to procure that <hi>Ariomant</hi> might ſecretly come to her, to be ſatisfied from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56329:21"/>his own mouth, touching the Story of his life, and the whole truth of his original; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not poſſible, without the knowledge of <hi>Liſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> who day nor night was abſent from her, ſhe thought, that if <hi>Liſimantus</hi> ſhould have acceſs to his Princeſs, at thoſe times when ſhe ſhould have a mind to entertain her Lover, beſides that <hi>Ariomant</hi> would never yield to make himſelf known before ſo many people, there would be likewiſe too many witneſſes, unto a matter, which was as yet not time to be reveal'd to any body; all theſe conſiderations, caus'd her to inſiſt upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy quality of a ſubject, and to tell <hi>Liſimena,</hi> that though her Lover, ſo vertuous, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd as he was, being a ſubject to the King her father, and the meanneſs of his birth but too too ſure; ſhe ſhould do her ſelf great wrong to ſpeak with him in private, and to allow his open Love; ſhe wiſht her, to have a little patience, ſeeing her honor was more deer unto her than his love, and it may be <hi>Liſimantus</hi> great achievements would ſo touch the King, who had already ſpied his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous inclination, as that he voluntarily might give him his ſucceſſion, by making her his wife.</p>
               <p>See here how <hi>Orazia</hi> diverted <hi>Liſimena</hi> from the deſire to which ſhe exceedingly enclined, to admit, and talk with <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> who was as beautiful, as bold, and being no leſſe eloquent, than valiant, had doubtleſſely, at firſt daſh, greatly ſhaken this Princeſſes reſolution. Lets leave her then in her concealed trouble, and likewiſe the ſad memory, of all the anguiſh, cauſed by <hi>Arontus</hi> death, and turn us to our Lovers joy, who with a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56329:22"/>alike deſire, ſeek how to meet again, and burn with one impatience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariomant</hi> knew nothing of the care, which poor <hi>Arontus</hi> had, lying a dying, to advertiſe his ſiſter of his high deſcent; and meaning with his deer friend <hi>Calliſtenus</hi> to retuan into <hi>Cambaye,</hi> that ſuddainly they might come back in Princes equipage, and conſummate their faithful Loves; he laboured to receive the fair <hi>Orazia's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and meant before he went, to tell her ſecretly, his great extraction, that as yet he might be more acceptable unto her, and more worthy of her favours, which he had already but too much a acquir'd, when <hi>Saradin</hi> the Princeſſe new Squire, to whom ſhe had given truſt of all her ſecrets, came to him from her, and ſaid as follows, to his no leſſe great aſtoniſhment, than Joy.</p>
               <p>Illuſtrious <hi>Ariomant</hi> (ſaid he,) without Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, I can tell the trouble you are in; and have no other errant, than to help you out; I know you labour to be private with the Princeſſe; and what ſay you, if ſhe deſire it too, and if already knowing by Divine revelation part of your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe have ſent me to you, to entreat your company, as ſoon as may be, and to hear the ſtory of your life, and matters, which but from your ſelf ſhe cannot learn. Wonder not Sir, ſaid he; you have ſeen me formerly a ſervant to <hi>Arontus,</hi> and my long, and known fidelity in ſeveral affairs, has made me acceptable to the Princeſſe, who hath done me the honor to think me fit to exerciſe an office in her houſe, which by the death of her
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56329:22"/>chief Squire, fell vacant; beſides, ſhe hath thought fit to open me her heart, and tell me how ſhe loves you, which ſhe hath Inherited, from her Brother, who ſo dearly tendred you; come go with me if you deſire to know more; for I am only charged to bring you where ſhe is, and have detain'd you with my paſt diſcourſe, that you might only truſt my faith and word.</p>
               <p>Sure <hi>Ariomants</hi> paſſion muſt have been extream, ſeeing his heart, which till that time ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, or at leaſt ordinary in its joy, appeared now a long time in his countenance diſordered by the alteration which that pleaſing news had cauſed in him; we may from thence collect, that Love is the moſt tickling, and delicate, of all the motions of the ſoul; for commonly, the greateſt courages, are moſt indifferent to every other joy, than thoſe, which come from the ſucceſſes of their Loves.</p>
               <p>When our brave <hi>Heroe,</hi> was recovered from his tranſport, he thank'd the faithful <hi>Saradin,</hi> for having by his care delivered him from ſo great trouble, and follow'd him alone, without the leaſt diſtruſt, unto the little Garden of Fountains, where the amorous Princeſſe did expect him.</p>
               <p>The Sun already had been ſet, an hour, or more, and the Moon, being about the Full, without offence of any Cloud, began to ſhine, when the fair <hi>Orazia</hi> as wel to take the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, of the freſhneſs, of ſo fair, and clear, a night, as without hinderance, to give acceſs unto her Lover, walked alone, ſave with the Princeſs of <hi>Zeilan,</hi> in the little Garden which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56329:23"/>their neighbouring privacies, and which was common to them both, wherein they had forbidden any body to be ſeen. Although ſhe with impatience look'd for <hi>Ariomant,</hi> ſhe could not chooſe but be ſurpriſed at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; ſhe ſtay'd her in a verdant Parlor, and dewed with a Chriſtall Fountain, which being plac'd againſt the wall, ran out into the City; for there it was that <hi>Saradin</hi> muſt bring him in, for fear leaſt in the walk, ſome of the Princeſs houſhold might diſcover him, becauſe their windows lookt into the Garden.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had that lovely Prince appeared to her eyes, by whom he was as much beloved, as he loved, but Love and Joy tranſporting him, he kneel'd, and after having kiſt her hand: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam ſaid he, is it poſſible, that you have thought me worthy of ſo great a happineſs, and glory: hold me no longer in ſuſpence, tell me, ah tell me, if my eyes deceive me, or whether it be a reall act of my good fortune, which preſents me to you. His wonder did not ſo much blind him, but he knew his duty towards <hi>Liſimena;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he roſe immediatly to give her ſalutations, with as great civility, as gracefulneſs, before he thus was anſwered by <hi>Orazia.</hi> Moſt generous Prince, ſaid ſhe, you can no longer hide you from me, The gods have granted me diſcovery of part of your illuſtrious birth; and ſurely, being as you are, the real proofs you ſhall here receive of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, &amp; eſteem, wil be but much below your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; do not, I pray you therefore feign, (before this Princeſs, whoſe perfect union with me, gives us
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56329:23"/>both but one deſire,) to tell me that, at full, which but in part, has yet arriv'd my knowledge. Tell me of all the fortunes you have ran, before your comming hither, and above all, conceal not from me, the chief cauſe, that guided you, into theſe parts.</p>
               <p>Madam, replyed <hi>Ariomant,</hi> ſince for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of us mortals, you are here below, and ſince you are by all acknowledg'd, for a moſt viſible divinity on earth, I cannot wonder at your knowledge of me. Goddeſſes, cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, of any thing; they pierce into ment hearts, and wills; And being ſo, how comes it Madam, you demand of me, the cauſe that brought me hither? can it be poſſible, that you, who have read o're my heart, have not found there, your Picture drawn by <hi>Cupids</hi> hand. In truth, I thought whiles we aboad at <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> I had made that doubt clear enough, and fear'd, I had thereby tranſgreſſed. For though, from that time you had known the truth of my extraction, I ought not for all that, ſo much to hazard me, as to declare my love unto you, nor ſhould have had a ground, to flatter me with any hope; I knew, it muſt be needs ſome God, that ſhould enjoy you, and that never any, ſuch as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, ſubject themſelves, except in antient ſtories, to the love of mortall men.</p>
               <p>Their complements had longer laſted if an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident had not prevented them; The King did uſe to viſit his daughter the Princeſs, twice, or thrice a week, in her retirement, and ſometimes uſed to walk with her in her little Garden: this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56329:24"/>cauſed <hi>Saradin,</hi> whoſe care provided for all chances, after he had left our Lovers together, to play the ſentinell, not fearing, after ſo ſtrict charge was given, that any ſave the King would venture to come in; and when he ſaw, that his Majeſty not finding <hi>Orazia</hi> in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, went towards the Garden, he ran before him, to give notice of it, to them; This newes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what troubled the company, who after <hi>Orazia</hi> had commanded <hi>Ariomant,</hi> to be next evening with his deer <hi>Callistenus</hi> at the ſame place, were fain, for that time to divide themſelves.</p>
               <p>This viſit, though ſhe loved her Father very well, was nothing acceptable: for ſhe impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently deſired to know his name, and quallity, whom yet ſhe knew, but by the name of <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> although indeed ſhe was not ignorant that he was born a Prince; beſides, that <hi>Ariomant</hi> ſuppoſing ſhe had know his whole extraction, was wonderfully doubtfull, who ſhould have inſtructed her, not daring to imagine that <hi>Aron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> had in dying faild his promiſe; for he had ever promiſed him, and <hi>Calliſtenus</hi> too, that he would never make them known, ſave to his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Orazia,</hi> till themſelves were fit, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to appear before the King of <hi>Narſingus</hi> as their qualities required; and death preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, he thought, (as was moſt likely,) that he had committed that ſecret to the faithfull <hi>Saradin;</hi> doubtfull however, he retired as then, reſolved to be next night, in due obedience to his Miſtreſſes commands, where now they met, and very ſhortly after to embarque himſelf for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56329:24"/>
                  <hi>Cambaye,</hi> that with as much ſpeed as may be, he might return with <hi>Calliſtenus,</hi> (who had like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to come back with him,) in a pompous train, and faſhion, worthy of their royall great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Scarce had he ſet his foot within his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but his dear <hi>Calliſtenus</hi> meeting him, knew by hit eyes, the pleaſure that took up his heart, and preſently he found himſelf engaged to tell him of his ſweet adventure; which better to communicate, they lay that night together, which they ſpent in pleaſing talk, till next day adminiſtred more ample cauſe of joy; for though this pleaſure ſeemed to have reſpect alone to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riomant; Calliſtenus</hi> who ſo intirely loved him, participated alſo of it, and ſo much, as very neer to ſhew the ſame impatience, and deſire.</p>
               <p>If now, Prince <hi>Ariomant</hi> for his part languiſht in that amorous expectation, The fair <hi>Orazia</hi> lived in a ſweet unquietneſs, on hers; little that night ſhe reſted, and the dry once come, ſhe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred every hour, and minute of the ſame; ſhe thought a thouſand times, the ſun had ſlack'd his wonted courſe, and dream'd on nothing, but the ſilence of a night, more happy than the former, that with more conveniency ſhe might again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, whoſe gracefulneſs, and ſweet behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, form'd themſelves a thouſand times that day to her imagination. Her wiſhes, when the Sun had ſet, were granted; for inſteed thereof, ſhe ſaw her deereſt <hi>Ariomant</hi> appear, whoſe ſight was more pleaſing unto her eyes, and warmth more acceptable to her ſoul: he with his friend, thought firſt to have been at the place, but found
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56329:25"/>himſelf prevented by the Princeſs great impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who had ſcarce given <hi>Liſimena</hi> time to end her Supper, for her haſt to draw her to that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and delightfull place.</p>
               <p>She was of brown but clear complexion, as all the beauties commonly of <hi>Aſia,</hi> are; But in all <hi>Europe</hi> was not found a favour, more exact, nor delicate than hers, ſhe had no part of all her face, which was not accompanied with ſpeciall graces; and eyes, which for their ſweetneſs might be feared, had yet more boldneſs to acquire mens hearts, than others.</p>
               <p>When ſhe went to find the Princeſs <hi>Liſimena</hi> in her Chamber, ſhe had caſt careleſly about her, a kind of <hi>Indian</hi> garment, of black Sattin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Ornament, than a cutwork, very delicate, wherewith her ſmock was edged, and turn'd back upon her garment; about her neck ſhe only wore a bobbin, her hair was black, and curl'd by nature into ſlaves, hung in ſome places on her neck, whoſe luſtre was the more ſet off, and though it was in careleſs manner that it hung, yet ſeem'd it not without a kind of art. 'Tis true, her mourning did require more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, than at that time her habit ſhew'd; and yet did <hi>Liſimena</hi> think her too ſevere; Siſter (ſaid ſhe) ſo much mourning does not become you well, on this occaſion, where nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhould be expreſt, and therewithall, rather in jeſt, than earneſt, ſhe untied her ſtring from her neck, and in its room, hung on, a ſtring of coſtly Pearl, which lay upon her Table; next, under colour of the heat, which was not over,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56329:25"/>ſhe truſt her foreſleeves up unto her elbowes, and delivered her a rich Bracelet of Diamonds which ſhe wore her ſelf, pull'd off her Gloves, that her fair hands might ſhew themſelves, and took away the Handkerchief, that hid her neck, and would not conceal from <hi>Ariomant</hi> a part of her perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; After this manner, <hi>Liſimena</hi> accompanied her deer <hi>Orazia,</hi> to her cloſet, wraped with leaves, without more company than little <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,</hi> whom they diſtruſted not, and bore his Miſtreſs train, for that ſhe had not time enough for haſte to make her ſelf unready.</p>
               <p>A very little time had they been there, when <hi>Ariomant,</hi> together with his faithfull friend <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtenus,</hi> ſlid ſecretly into the door, which lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City, and whereof, he had the key de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him. Many, and happy were the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements that paſt on either ſide, But, though there be no excellency, wherewith they were not accompanyed, and all their words ſelected, ſuch as love form'd in their mouths, delighting to propoſe, and anſwer for our Lovers, I forbear repeating of them, leſt the Readers take offence, and becauſe <hi>Ariomant</hi> perceiv'd by <hi>Orazia's</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that ſhe yet knew not his extraction, and that ſhe long'd to know it from his mouth, which, he would gladly have excuſed, if man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would have let him; But ſeeing no way how he could refuſe, at length, being all four ſat, and that their ſilence witneſſed their defires to hear; he thus began to ſay.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt fair, and vertuous Princeſs,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you deſire to know who I am, and from my own mouth to learn the Hiſtory, of mine, and the companion of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, my deer Friend <hi>Calliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his Life; I am moſt willing to obey you; and although, our Croſſes have been great, and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, our voyage more than common, yet find I more contentment, than diſpleaſure in reflecting on them, when I call to mind, how you are the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56329:27"/>ſole object of our hazards, and that for your love only we have undertaken them.</p>
               <p>But ere I ſhip me in that long diſcourſe, 'tis fit I juſtifie the good opinion, you have of my birth, that if our merits be not equall, you may at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe find our qualities, as like as our affections; and that you may be able to make good the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you have done me, to accept my ſervice, ere you very well had known me.</p>
               <p>It cannot be, but you have often heard of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidaris,</hi> who being deſcended from the great <hi>Tamberlin,</hi> and only remainder of his race, hath to the Empire of <hi>Cambaye,</hi> joyn'd the Kingdoms of <hi>Dulcinde, Candahar,</hi> and <hi>Mandao,</hi> and who at preſent, with your Father, ſhares the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the <hi>Indes.</hi> From him 'tis (Madame,) whence I derive my ſelf, &amp; who hath bred me, in the hope of all his Kingdomes, which ſurely I ſhould ſcorn, but for the hope I have to reign in them, one day, with you. Hereat the Princeſs <hi>Orazia</hi> could not conceal her joy of heart, to be beloved by ſo great a Prince, but interrupting him, did ſay, that both the greatneſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings of <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> were as the Sun, ſo known unto her. But, reply'd <hi>Ariomant,</hi> becauſe we are not ſo neer neighbours, but that many Hills, and Rivers ſeparate us, and for it may be you have never heard of all the paſſages of my Fathers Life, which do concern my Story; I muſt briefly tell you, that this Prince at five and twenty yeares of age, was Heir unto the Kingdome of <hi>Guzarat,</hi> which you call otherwiſe, <hi>Cambaye;</hi> he married, (more for policy of ſtate, than force of love,) the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56329:27"/>Princeſs <hi>Berenica,</hi> who was only daughter, and heir, unto the King of <hi>Candahar,</hi> and of <hi>Mandao</hi> his neighbour, and his tributary (who ſhortly after died) and by that match enlarged his limits to the Northern parts, even to the Mountain of <hi>Nogrocot,</hi> which the Greeks call <hi>Paropamiſſe,</hi> from whence the famous River <hi>Indus</hi> ſprings, which, but for only watering our Lands, gives name to all the <hi>Indes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this unhappy Queen, who did Idolatriſe her Husbands vertues, liv'd but a ſhort time with him, after her fathers death, but on whole year; wherein, ſhe gave him all imaginable proofes of perfect love, and ſo far forth, as having in her ſelf free power, ſhe gave him, be it, whether the child wherewith ſhe went did live, or otherwiſe, her two fair Crowns; and juſt as ſoon as ſhe had brought that little Prince into the world, with pains incredible, ſhe, choaked in her Convulſions; and the firſt hower of her childbed, gave the laſt unto her life.</p>
               <p>Now though <hi>Alcidaris</hi> were not enſirely ſo much tender of her, at ſhe of him, nor had the juſt, ſame feelings, that ſhe had, yet could not chuſe but by that unexpected death, receive moſt ſtrong impreſſions; great was the grief he ſhewed, and whatſoever pomp, the quality of ſo great, and vertuous a Princeſſe, as ſhe was, requir'd, did wait upon his mourning, and her Funerals.</p>
               <p>But as there is no wound, however it may ſeem incurable, but time may heal, this which <hi>Alcidaris</hi> received, was not ſo great, as that there needed a whole age to comfort him; for after
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56329:28"/>one year ended, he became moſt paſſionably ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored of the Queen <hi>Anaxareta,</hi> who, by the death of her brother <hi>Spimantus,</hi> newly being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, was heir unto the Kingdom of <hi>Dulcinda,</hi> which, does on the one ſide border on the King my fathers Countries, and on <hi>Perſia</hi> on the other.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why ſo paſſionately he purſu'd that Love, was, that beſides his pleaſure, there was profit in it; and thought, that by uniting <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda</hi> to his other Kingdoms, he ſhould be an equal powerful neighbour to the Perſian.</p>
               <p>Perſwaded by theſe reaſons, but more by love, that forced him, he ſent one named <hi>Pirobus,</hi> and of the ableſt of his Kingdom, in Embaſſage to the Queen <hi>Anaxareta.</hi> He was receiv'd, as coming from ſo great a Prince, with much magnificence: but wondred greatly, that the anſwer he received was no more favorable: She only told him thus, that the King of <hi>Cambaye</hi> had done her a great deal of honour, but that the King her brother, being ſo lately dead, and having ſcarce wip'd off her tears, it could not be, ſhe ſhould ſo ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him, nor in ſuch haſte run from his Funerals, to her own eſpouſals; and therefore pray'd the King his Maſter, not to hold it ſtrange, that ſhe deſired more time to think thereof.</p>
               <p>This Embaſſador, who was a man of great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and knew the extream paſſion of <hi>Alcida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> reſting but poorly ſatisfied with this anſwer, and knew his Maſter would be likewiſe ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought him, that of Force, ſome greater reaſon muſt reſtrain the Queen than of her brothers
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56329:28"/>death, who almoſt two years ſince had died, and ſhould have cauſ'd her greater joy, than ſorrow; for which cauſe, he makes adreſſes to the chiefeſt Statiſt there, and dives into him, to diſcover, if he could, his Miſtriſs meanings; he ſhews him, how the King of <hi>Cambaye,</hi> was her neer neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and one of the moſt powerful Monarchs of the <hi>Indies.</hi> That over and above, his greatneſs, and his wealth, he had all qualities which might commend a man to a fair Ladies acceptation; that in all <hi>Aſia,</hi> his Miſtreſſe could not finde a fitter match; that there needed no long time, to think upon a matter which depended only on her will; And, that he knew not what to infer by the coldneſs of her anſwer, ſave that ſhe loved ſome other, ſince ſhe neglected the deſires of a Prince ſo mighty, and one, who could not be, but a great ſtrength unto her.</p>
               <p>This States-man who deſired to pay him with more ſolid reaſons than the Queen had done, thought, twas no matter of importance if he told him, what he gueſt ſhe thought, which was, that being of a mighty ſpirit, and knowing that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidaris</hi> had had a ſon by the Queen <hi>Berenica,</hi> who as himſelf, was call'd <hi>Alcadaris,</hi> and ſhould when he were dead, poſſeſſe his Kingdoms, ſhe could not abide, that thoſe, that ſhould proceed from her, ſhould ever happen to be ſeconds, or in rank, or in affection; and being able to diſpoſe of the Kingdom of <hi>Dulcinda,</hi> ſhe thought ſhe might do better, to chuſe out a Gentleman, her Subject, who ſhould be her creature, and by whom ſhe might have children heirs to her poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56329:29"/>than to match a King, of whoſe inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhe could not ſee a hope for hers. And this ſaid he, in my opinion is the cauſe, that backs the Queen: for ſhe is not ſo ignorant, both of the qualities, and vertues of the King your Maſter, but that ſhe holds him for the man of moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for her choice, ſave only that his heir is born already.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pirobus,</hi> more ſatisfi'd herewith, than by the reaſons given him from the Queen, though very little notwithſtanding, ſeeing how far from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving comfort to his Maſter, returns towards him, and from point to point gives him account of his Embaſſage. <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> as well as poſſible he could, diſſembled the diſquiet this il news procur'd him, and I know not if his love oblig'd him, or, that as yet, ſome little hope remained for him. But, as if heaven would favour his deſires, about eight, or ten months end, report ran all about, that the young Prince <hi>Alcidaris</hi> was very ſick, and that his tender age, not able to defend it ſelf, againſt the ſtrong aſſaults of a continued Feavor, death had delivered him. The ſorrow which the King put on, was ſo great, that for the ſpace of forty daies, he ſuffred not himſelf to be ſeen by any creatures, except <hi>Pirobus,</hi> his faithful Counſellour. The noiſe of his great loſſe immediately was ſpread throughout, and came to the Queen <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxaretas</hi> ears, who, ſeeing that great obſtacle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, deſir'd no greater thing in all the world than that alliance; and in a word to end, <hi>Pirobus</hi> being ſent the ſecond time had his deſire, and ſome few daies after, did <hi>Alcidaris</hi> poſſeſſe both

                  <hi>Anaxaretas</hi> beauties, and her Kingdoms, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Now Madam, from that happy Marriage I am ſprung, and named <hi>Anaxander</hi> from my Mothers name.</p>
               <p>Almoſt about the ſame time I was born, <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta,</hi> Queen of <hi>Citor,</hi> and only ſiſter to the King my father, was delivered of <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> whom you ſee here under name of <hi>Callistenus;</hi> we were bred up and taught together; and beſides our age, and blood, which knit us in a perfect friendſhip, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture augmented it by ſo exact a correſpondency of humours, as never was obſerved the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity in our opinions; and truly ſince our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath foundation but on vertue only, tis not to be admired, that from a cauſe eternal, ſuch effects of everlaſtingneſs are ſeen.</p>
               <p>The wiſe <hi>Evander,</hi> from my tendreſt youth had me in government, and <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> who much deſired to frame me after the example of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable man, drew him from the Province of <hi>Carmanie,</hi> on very great expence: for he was Maſter of ſome nine or ten Languages, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of nothing, that another man did know. He had not only care of me, but likewiſe had an eye to <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> whom he found exceeding capable of his good doctrines; and we both ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by his inſtructions, as we ſoon learned all the ſecrets of the Perſian and Arabique tongues, which travel moſtly, throughout all the Indies this ſide <hi>Ganges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides the recreations of our minds, we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſ'd our bodies likewiſe; and familiarly diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſelves, on daies of ceremony, or delight,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56329:30"/>we got the prizes with our Lances, and at Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing too; and ſuch as had our names in queſtion us'd to ſay, that if we were not above ſeventeen years of age, we might procure the envy of the moſt expert and accompliſht Knights of <hi>Gouza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi> I ask you humble pardon Madam, if in this, or any other part of my diſcourſe, I chance to ſpeak in commendation of my own exploits, ſince I have ſaid already, that the gods diſpos'd my humour like to <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without prejudice to him, ſpeak meanly of my ſelf; and ſeeing we have both purſu'd the ſame adventures, there is no glory which I may have ſtollen, but he ſhareth with me in the theft.</p>
               <p>We were of eighteen years compleat, before we felt the ſmalleſt ſenſe of Love; and did enjoy, all harmleſs pleaſures, that our age aloud. If ſometimes, wearied with our exerciſe, or tired with Hunting, we frequented Dancing Matches, and beſtowed our time in viſiting of Ladies, twas only for civility, or manners ſake; or rather, through perſwaſions of <hi>Evander,</hi> who, finding us, to have obtain'd enough of what he ſhew'd us, ſaid often to the King, we wanted nothing but a little Love, and that the leaſt time we ſhould take delight to ſpend with Ladies, would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compiſh us, for people of breeding; becauſe, ſaid he, Love hath this proper to it ſelf, to waken, and refine the mind, and raiſe it to high meditations, making it likewiſe able for moſt glorious under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</p>
               <p>With ſuch diſcourſes likewiſe did he often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56329:30"/>us, wherein we much delighted; and ſure, we were like thoſe, who from a far, diſcover beauteous proſpects, but know not what waies lead unto them; we every day ſaw ſtore of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties within the City of <hi>Campanel,</hi> where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>Alcidaris</hi> does hold his Court: but in their faces, found not the effects of good <hi>Evanders</hi> words. But on a day, being in the Queen <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxareta's</hi> Cloſet, where leaſt of any thing I thought of Love, that god upon a ſuddain made me know his power, and let me ſee, that if till then he had omitted me, twas only, by a favour extraordinary, to reſerve me, pure, and whole, to ſerve the moſt incomparable <hi>Orazia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being I ſay, within the Queen my mothers Cloſet, where certain Merchants of <hi>Arabia</hi> which traded into <hi>China,</hi> were allowed to enter, and had about them, all the rarities of thoſe parts they had paſt through; They unfolded, among others that they had, a Picture, which ſurpriz'd the eyes of all the Curt, and made them inſtantly confeſt, that if it were a piece drawn by the life, the Lady that it repreſented was the greateſt beauty of the world; you are not much deceiv'd, ſaid one of the Merchants, for tis an original, after the Princeſſe <hi>Orazia,</hi> drawn by a Chinois Painter, now abiding in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Narſingus,</hi> at a great allowance of the Kings, as being the renowned Painter of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> And this fair <hi>Orazia,</hi> is ſole daughter to that mighty King, worthy indeed, more for her rare perfections, to nommand all men, than for her great deſcent.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56329:31"/>
               <p>No ſooner had I caſt my eyes upon that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Picture, but ſuddenly I found an alteration in my heart, and was a certain augure of my new Loves birth. <hi>Piroxonus,</hi> who could read my ſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts, know by my change of face, and my reiterated commendations of that piece, that it had touch'd me more than pictures uſe to do: The Queen on t' other ſide perceiv'd I had a liking to it, and though ſhe had a purpoſe to have kept it for her Cloſet, ſhe beſtowed it on me, and as deer a preſent I eſteem'd it, as the life ſhe gave me. I therefore took it with me, and it ſoon became the moſt invaluable part of all my goods. I could not hide from my deer <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light I took therein, he was the witneſs of my tranſports, and my exſtacies, which often in his preſence, with ſuch meditations, I accompanied.</p>
               <p>O worthy inaſterpiece of Art, as the great beauty you preſent, muſt be of Nature, can it be poſſible, that you ſhould have at firſt, more power upon me, than ſo many living wonders, who ſo long, in vain, have ſought to ſnare my liberty; and that your ſweetneſs without motion, which but in ſhadows, and in lines, is repreented here, can kindle in my ſoul, ſo pure, and living flames? Indeed, I thought, that the divinity, of whom you a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the image, did communicate its power, but unto Love alone, and that he only was allow'd, to take from her fair eyes, the fiery ſhafts, where with he burneth all the World; and yet I by this table ſee, a mortal hath by force of his imagination, ſhared reputation with a god, and burns me with the ſhafts, which he hath drawn, from the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>Orazias</hi> charms.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56329:31"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> ſeeing that in carneſt I was taken, did what he could to pleaſe my paſſion, which, by ſo great a beauty, was ſo juſtly cauſed, and was the firſt, that to deliver me from my continuall thoughtfulneſs, advis'd that we might ſecretly make a journey to <hi>Narſinga;</hi> and that it was high time, to manifeſt our ſelves in ſome brave action; and that beſides, an univerſal peace being throughout the Countries of <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> we ſhould go ſome where elſe, to ſeek adventures, both of Love, and Armes. Judge you, fair Princeſs, if this were acceptable counſel, yea or no, and whether a greater teſtimony, of my deer Cozins friendſhip could be given me. I muſt confeſs if he prevented me, twas only by his ſpeech: for all my purpoſes were that way bent, and if I had been ſo unhappy, as that he had been of other mind, I muſt confeſs before him here, I ſhould have hazarded to leave him, and that a meer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity would force my ſeparation from him, to go joyn me to the faireſt, and moſt excellent part of my ſoul.</p>
               <p>After that time, we often uſed to retire in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, that more freely we might talk of my new paſſion, and to conſider how to ſteal away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; but we could not ſo conceal our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, but the wiſe <hi>Evander,</hi> who at all hours came into my Cloſet, did ſurprize us, and had learned ſomething of my Love, but not of our deſign; for though in earneſtneſs of talk we might ſometimes be loud, yet held we, at the leaſt noiſe made, for fear of being diſcovered. But one day, looking (I know not how before he entred)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56329:32"/>through a crany of the door, and finding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>How ever, he was very glad, to ſee we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to rouze our ſelves a little, and to finde by our diſcourſe, our ſtony hearts began to mollifie. But coming ſuddainly upon us, and at an inſtant huſht, he could not chuſe but make a little war upon us, and eſpecially on me.

               <p>Verily, Madam, I was never ſo ſurpriz'd in all my life, by any accident, as at his words, and twas great hap, but in the exigent I was, I had from point to point diſcovered all our purpoſes, and conjur'd him to aſſiſt us; but when I ſaw he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued on his jeſting, &amp; ſpake not of our voyage, I gueſt he had diſcover'd nothing; ſo as we were content to keep on ſporting with him, without ſo much as ſtriving to deny the love whereof he had accuſed us. However, ſince that time, we more reſerv'd our ſelves: and that at length, we might be free from thoſe diſturbances, our fears, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56329:32"/>our continual jealouſies had kept us in, we took a firm, and valiant reſolution, to go on with our deſign, which we conceal'd from all the world, except two Gentlemen, that had from youths been bred with us, and whoſe entire affections, and fidelity to do us ſervice, we had known: He whom I took, and who is with me ſtill, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Almerin,</hi> and he alone wen tout of <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> with us, becauſe we thought it ſit to leave <hi>Neander,</hi> (for ſo was <hi>piroxenus</hi> Squire called) as a ſpie, ſome daies at Court, to learn, what would be ſaid of our departure, and gave him <hi>Pala,</hi> for a randezvous, which is ſome either, or nine daies journy off, from <hi>Campanel;</hi> and for that Town is in the deſert, and neer joyning to the oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Gate,</hi> a little from the apſſage to <hi>Narſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> which we went, we thought that few would have imagined we had gone a way ſo ſteep and difficult. We were a thouſand times, about to ſhip our ſelves at the Port of <hi>Cambaye,</hi> but thought the voyage would be over-long by ſea, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the King your fathers Court might be an <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> which would much ſhorten our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſave us labour to croſſe over the high Mountains of <hi>Gate,</hi> which as we underſtand, do ſeparate your two Kingdoms; and have ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as to divide the Winter, and the Summer ſo betwixt them, as when tis could at <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> tis warm at <hi>Narſinga.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We were the more invited to go by land, for the defire we had, to paſſe through the Kingdom of <hi>Decan,</hi> which lay in our way; whereof we had heard great praiſes, and that among all the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56329:33"/>Royal Courts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> there was not any which exceeded that, whereof the gallantry was a the higheſt degree that could be wiſht, and Ladies courteous as in any part of the World, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolv'd to go that way, in ſome ſort to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh our ſelves, as to obſerve, whether it were a truth was ſaid of it, that of all parts of <hi>India,</hi> men were beſt on horſoback there, and where all the Rules of fencing (which my Couzin and my ſelf knew very well) were beſt obſerved.</p>
               <p>We therefore, <hi>Piroxenus</hi> and my ſelf, when as the Moon was one night very favourable to our flight, ſtole out of <hi>Campanel,</hi> without more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany then <hi>Almerin,</hi> for we had left <hi>Meander</hi> in the City; and when we had advanc'd ſome ten Leagues forward, I found my Couſin had had more foreſight than I; for doubting that we might be followed when 'twas day, being found wanting; he had commanded a ſervant of his call'd <hi>Madaron,</hi> whoſe honeſty he long time knew, to go two dayes before, with a couple of excellent horſes, upon one of which, himſelf was mounted, and led the other in his hand, and gave him charge to ſtay for us, at a little Town call'd <hi>Oby,</hi> which is ſome twenty Leagus from <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi> upon the road of <hi>Pala,</hi> and was <hi>Neanders</hi> Rendezvous.

               <p>Next day, our people, without any accident came to us, and we altogether, undiſcover'd, took our way to <hi>Pala.</hi> We had not long been there, before <hi>Neander</hi> came unto us, from whom we learnt, in how great trouble, all the court was, at our abſence; and that indeed, the firſt two or three dayes, they were not ſo much troubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought we had been gone about ſome ſecret wantonneſſe: but when the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, no newes was to be had of us, his anger maſtred him, and if the Queen had not reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he would have gone beyond the bounds of Fatherly affection; Theſe are ſaid ſhe, but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56329:34"/>tricks of youth, which are to be excus'd; and me thinks no ſtrange matter that young Princes, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in continual reſtraint, run out a little, and a while ſeek the freedom which our Court af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords them not. 'Tis altogether contrary, ſaid the King, for Princes ought not to commit ſuch follies; Their Governours, and good inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given them, together with their births, ſhould make them old before their time, and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned as they are from every where, their meaneſt actions ſhould be ſquared ſo, as to be good examples for the world; and me thinks they that cannot rule their paſſions, are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to have power of men.</p>
               <p>But neither King, nor Queens diſpleaſure, might compare with ſage <hi>Evanders</hi> diſcontent. That Grave old man, who loved us only, and who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his other excellent Sciences, had alſo cunning in the art of divination, which among the Perſians is a common thing, had found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his other Speculations, that <hi>Piroxenus</hi> and my ſelf, ſhould at two ſeverall times, run hazard of an extraordinary, and a violent death; and fearing leſt effects might follow his predictions, remembring us ſo often to retire in private, and to have heard us ſpeak of <hi>Orazia's</hi> Picture, he ſuſpected, we might ſecretly have undertaken a voyage to <hi>Narſinga,</hi> and more, he was confirm'd in his belief, and apprehenſion, when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that, that ſame night, wherein we had departed, a Ship having the wind at large, had from the Port of <hi>Cambaye,</hi> hoyſed Sail towards the Iſle of <hi>Zeilan;</hi> Where the War was hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <p>As ſoon as this Proclamation by the Herald was concluded, we withdew our ſelves out of the throng that compaſſed him, extreamly pleas'd, that an occaſion ſhould ſo ſoon be offered after our arrivall wherein our skill might be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and knowing very well the Language, for the great conformity it hath with ours, having enquired of the firſt we met, where we ruight be conveniently lodged, we were conducted by one of them unto a houſe of his, which was both great and ſpacious, where certain other ſtrangers were already entertain'd, which flockt from at all parts there, againſt the great ſolemnity.</p>

Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, Frontſtalls, Foot-cloaths, Targets, Darts, and Spears, we fitted all, and went, and rank'd our ſelves under the Prince <hi>Araxus</hi> Standard, who was Chief of the adventurers, and having a good liking to us, although he took us but for Perſian Knights, aſſign'd us God-fathers, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd us with all manner of civility; and becauſe he would not diſcontent a great many Lords of note, who had as well as we, diſpoſed themſelves under his colours, he privately paſſed a moſt obliging complement unto us, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make us think he held his party much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by our helps. But as you ſhall perceive, that argument of his friendſhip, coſt us very dear,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56329:37"/>for from that time his Brother <hi>Demonax</hi> grew very jealous of us, and delighted ever ſince, to ſhew us publique ſcornes, and ſought by all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion how to hurt us: But we were comforted, to ſee, how even to his own Siſter <hi>Orixa</hi> he ſhew'd a very ill affection; becauſe ſhe could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his Couzin the Prince <hi>Palandurus</hi> love, whom <hi>Demonax</hi> eſteem'd, and favour'd all he could: and this withdrew him from his Siſters friendſhip wholly, with a proteſtation, that at length ſhe ſhould repent the ſcorn ſhe had of his dear friend.</p>
               <p>To come again to my diſcourſe, after, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order, and the ancient cuſtom of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> the defendant, and aſſaylant, the Judges, and the Heralds, had made a pompous entrance into the City together, with the Knights, who had diſpos'd themſelves, to eithers Standard, the night before the Eve unto the Sports, and Combates, the Ladies, by the Queens commands, aſſembled in the Palace hall to Dance, of whoſe pomp, it may be, Madam, if I ſpeak a word, or two, it may not be unpleaſing.</p>
               <p>At one end of the room, there was a Theater erected, where the Queens State was placed; and over it, did ſparkle, twelve Candleſticks of Rnbies, and of Saphirs, mixt together, fill'd with an infinite number of Waxlights; about it were three degrees of ſeats, above each other, where the Princeſſes, the Ladies of honor, and the Queens Maids were ſet; and above all, the Queen her ſelf, upon a Chaire of black Velvet embroydered with Pearl, was rais'd about the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56329:37"/>middle of the moſt eminent degree, and on her right hand, ſat the Princeſſe <hi>Orixa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Ladies that ſhould dance, were clad in a clean other habit, than their cuſtom, and which they never uſed, but on ſuch daies of ceremony, or of publique feaſts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they were dreſſed in their hair, with a number of little flowers, and great ſprigs of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, came out at the middle of their Garlands, made of Pearl, and Diamonds; their veils were made of cloth of Silver, ſtrewed with little Pearl, and edged round with great; their Gowns of white Sattin, embrodered with Gold, and Silver, and throughout in works of greater Pearl, whoſe hanging ſleevers were likewiſe covered, and their coats about below; the edges were in ſcollops, and hem'd about with Pearl, and above all the dreſſing, the Gold and Silver embrodery, was ſo raiſed, as it ſeem'd to be of Gold-ſmiths work. They had all of them a kinde of great band, after the Perſian manner, with peakes and big Pearl hanging at them; The ſhining of the precious ſtones which were in their chains, joyning with the gliftring of Gold about their cloaths, did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly multiply the reflections of the light which came from the twelve Rubie, and Saphir Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delſticks, and of thirty more of Chriſtal ena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> milled with divers colours, which gave light to all the reſt of the Hall, where, both the Court, and City-Ladies had their places.</p>
               <p>Right oppoſite unto the Queens, was likewiſe rais'd a Theater for the King, who had on either hand, the two Princes, <hi>Demonaz,</hi> and <hi>Araxus;</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:56329:38"/>and at their feet, were all the Knights of note, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the ſame order, that the Ladies were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, as well the Subjects of that Kingdom, as the Strangers, who were come to honor that feaſt, all of them richly clad, and gliſtring, with the luſter of their Pearl, and Diamonds, and Rubies, which they wore in skarffs. The Maſter of the ceremonies, by <hi>Araxus</hi> commands, gave us our places; and though our habit was not ſo coſtly as the reſt, becauſe we had not time to invent them richer, or more brave; for <hi>Piroxenus</hi> and my ſelf had ſpent our time in practiſing the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian manner of dancing; as ſoon as we began to move they all roſe up to note our action, which was accompanied with a particular good grace: and the Princeſſe <hi>Orixa,</hi> after the Country cuſtom comming to take me, and commanding me to lead her a Dance, I ſo far pleas'd her with my faſhion, and my Complements, that from that time, ſhe ſhew'd me more of her good will, than I deſir'd ſhe ſhould; and truly I may ſay, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enterview, was the original of hers, and my misfortune.</p>
               <p>I will not buſie my ſelf, Madam, to deſcribe unto you here, all the figures of the Combate at that feaſt, and publique joy, although their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were the fineſt of the world, their entries ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the form of their field, the moſt glorious that I ever ſaw; becomming ſuch as often exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſuch gallantries, and who were held the moſt expert of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and happily of all the world, as well in horſemanſhip, as all brave exerciſes us'd on foot, to give delight and recreation unto Ladies.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56329:38"/>
               <p>It ſufficeth me to tell you, that after <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> and I, had in the combate of Spears, well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted our ſelves, under <hi>araxus</hi> Sandard, which Combate was perform'd after the Mooriſh faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Perſian, and wherein I was in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Court well exercis'd, I was amazed, when the Dancing began, as on the former night, the Princeſſe <hi>Orixa</hi> waied on, by ſix fair Ladies, and accompanied by the Judges, and the Heralds, came, and ſtaid her, juſt before that place of the Scaffold, where I was, and the King of Arms who went before her breaking the ſilence, made me this complement aloud, before them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taxilus,</hi> obſerve thy worth, and glorifie thy ſelf before this famous aſſembly, ſeeing a ſtranger, and unknown among us, as thou art, thou haſt been judged worthy of the prize, diſputed by the Combate of Spears, which here the beauteous Princeſſe <hi>Orixa,</hi> daughter to our great King <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monax</hi> comes to preent thee, waited on, by the impartial'ſt judges of the World, which ſhow, that favour is not uſed in this Country, and that the vertue, rather than the greatneſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants, all whom thou haſt exceeded by thy skill, is here preferred; wherefore receive this prize which our Princeſſe prays thee to accept, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from thence, that as the ancient cuſtom of this Kingdom is, thou mayſt by her be honored.</p>
               <p>I then in haſte came down, and the Princeſſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the prize, which was a big Ruby of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; I bowed my ſelf very low to thank her for the honour which ſhe did me, and to kiſſe her hand; but in ſuch ceremony ſhe uſed to kiſſe the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56329:39"/>conquerours face. In truth I was much taken with the favour, and yet more, when afterward my name was with a common, and loud voice borrowed from one to another through the Hall. Then preently the Trumpets ſounded (which were Gold,) to cauſe the noiſe to ceaſe, and the Princeſſe commanded me to lead her a Dance, where ſhe appear'd ſo beautiful, and ſweetly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as that <hi>Piroxenus</hi> moſt unhappily inclin'd to wiſh her well, as ſhe did me; for though indeed his parts were greater, and more worthy fo her love, than mine, yet being prevented by a former paſſion, having ſeen me firſt, ſhe was not able to turn her heart, or thoughts, upon another; and I, who had your living image printed in my heart, and taken up with a preoccupated will to give my ſelf to you, I could not fall in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that unhappy Princeſſ: charmes; who without lying might have raviſht any ſave my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Next day, with juſt the like order, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, was the Combate perform'd with Darts, where, whether I may ſay my god, or evill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would, I know not, I won again the prize: for being again preſented by that fair Princeſſ: hand; enjoy, ſaid ſhe ſoftly, in kiſſing it, courage Cavallier, there are other manner of prizes fitted for you.</p>
               <p>Truly Madam, I was at theſe words extreamly ſtrucken; for though I knew, there were other prizes to be play'd the daies following, and that, it may be, ſhe might have meaned them, which for my skill I might promiſe my ſelf; yet that ſo
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56329:39"/>great a Princeſſe, ſhou'd whiſper me in my car, as it were, a thing which a meer effect of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, might ſuffer her to ſpeak aloud, I could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Piroxenus</hi> who had ſtill eyes upon her, as the firſt and only object of his paſſion, ſaw well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that twas on me, ſhe caſt her wiſher, and her in my ear, (for I never concealed any thing from him) then was he troubled to the purpoſe, and cry'd out upon his evill fortune: dear <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Now, loving him (fair Princeſſe) as I did, and gueſſing at his paſſion by my own, I ſwear I ſuffred more than half his torment; and that in ſome ſort, I might ſwage his grief, I promis'd from that time, to do him all the faithful ſervice that I could.</p>
               <p>But it fell out, that in thoſe three daies follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which were ordain'd for Fencing, all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, fell on us: for there being three prizes alotted for that exerciſe, which is moſt frequent
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56329:40"/>among the Indians, ſometimes performed pill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell, ſometimes as Duel, one rival againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by permiſſion of the Ladies lov'd. Fortune would have it, that <hi>Araxus, Piroxenus</hi> and my ſelf, obtain'd them all, which much encreaſed <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monax</hi> his jealouſie, and bettred much the love, his brother bare to us. When the Princeſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me the priz: which was again adjudged me, ſhe gave me yet more favour in her looks, than formerly; but then her eyes eprform'd the office of her heart, and tongue, and by a ſweetly mixed ſmile, of love and joy, did more than ever make me invitation to her love. She wondered great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that among her many demonſtrations of good will, ſhe could perceive no alteration in my eyes, and that I ſtill contain'd my ſelf, and paſſed not the bounds of common complements: but as ſhe flattred her ſelf in her paſſion, ſhe did with caſe perſwade her ſelf, that it was only fear that made me ſilent, and imputed all my back warkneſs, to the reſpect I ought her quality. Thus by her fooliſh thoughts deceiv'd, ſhe let her motions ſway her wholly, and without dread of that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and rigorous Law, which did unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly condemn to death, that daughter of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blood, who ſhould admit the love of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man; the violence of her paſſion, making her more bold, than either her age, or ſex, or her condition did allow of; ſhe reſolv'd what ever hapned, to diſcover to me by letter, what ſhe thought, ſhe had not, by her eyes, her actions, and her words, enough declar'd, and willing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige her Nurſe (whoſe help ſhe needed) unto a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56329:40"/>ſecrecy of ſo great waight, and dangerous impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: when ſhe perceiv'd, how by her good, and ſolid reaſons ſhe reſiſted her; No, no, ſaid ſhe to her, my Nurſe, the reſolution is already taken, and in this matter, where alone the preer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of my life depends, I rather crave your help, than aske your counſel; thou art the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only, whoſe aſſiſtance, I can dare to ask, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy faith, and thy affection are ſo known unto me; if thou fail'ſt me at this need, ſaid ſhe, in tears, ſome ſword, or poyſon ſhall not. Theſe very words, ſhe ſince told <hi>Piroxenus</hi> of, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver concealed any thing from me, from whom I learnt beſides, that thus her Nurſe did anſwer her. Will you then Madam (ſaid ſhe) love a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, againſt your Country Laws; and more, againſt the Laws of honor and civility? having been ſtill, till now, a great example of vertue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, will you diſgrace your good deeds, by your haſty taking of a husband, whom you muſt follow, through ſtrange Countries, without reſt, or honor, and it may be without maintenance? what ſo diſordred appetite, perſwades you to imprint this blot upon your royal houſe, and ever after to diſhonor it? neither is that the leaſt that may befall you; for if it ſhould be known, you cannot ſhun a ſhameful death; but that the King your father, and the Princes your brothers, grown your enemies, will cauſe you to be burnt alive, a puniſhment inevitable to thoſe Princeſſes who from their blood, do derogate by an unequal choice.</p>
               <p>How mother, reply'd the Princeſſe, thinkſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56329:41"/>thou, that I, in <hi>Taxilus,</hi> have choſe a common man, what though with us he be unknown, his words and actions ſhew he is of royal birth, and though I had no other witneſs of his blood, than my own courage, aſſure thy ſelf, it is too great, to be ſubjected to a private mans affection; and that, that heart, whoſe vertue thou haſt ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, did never give ſo great a teſtimony, as when firſt it burned in ſo true a love, and ſigh'd for <hi>Taxilus.</hi> Help me I pray thee therefore, for whether, after I have in thy preſence, promiſed to Marry him, it be moſt fit to keep our paſſions ſecret, or elſe to follow him through deſerts, to avoid the King my fathers fury, but eſpecially my eldeſt brothers, who does hate me mortally; I never will forſake his company, nor reply thou more hereto, except thou wiſh me dead.</p>
               <p>The poor woman knew it would be labour loſt to make her more remonſtrances; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to how dangerous extremity, ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, finding her ſelf diſtracted by ſo ſeverall apprehenſions; her dear affection to her, and the pitty of her tears, prevail'd, at length, more with her, than the fear of her deſtruction, and the ruin of her honor; and for that cauſe furthered her deſires in all ſhe could, and ſo far forth, as to make choice of <hi>Callias,</hi> her own ſon, to ſerve, in that ſo dangerous a ſecret, which but to me alone, ſhe would be glad to have communicated, had the modeſty of ſex, and eminency of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſuffred her, to call me to the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Wedding by her perſonal demands, to which how ever ſhe ordain'd her ſelf, then

                  <hi>Callias,</hi> who was of the Princeſſes houſhold, and had a mind to quit himſelf with reputation of the charge was given him, cunning, and wary as he was, comes in the morning to my lodging, and having asked to ſpeak with me, from the Prince <hi>Araxus,</hi> ſays thus, ſoftly in my ear, while <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> and our people were in preſence, I preſent you, (Sir) with this letter in private, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know you cannot read it without ſome expreſſions: it contains a ſecret of importance, which does promiſe better fortune than you look for; but, ere you do receive it, I am charg'd to crave your anſwer, which I will come to fetch within this hour: becauſe, I know, the ſecret joy it brings you, will require ſome time to meditate thereon.</p>
               <p>After this complement delivered me, which yet, I could not comprehend, he went forth of my chamber, and I, retir'd into my Cloſet, where calling <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> I in his preſence opened the Princeſſe letter, which put us both into aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and truly Madam, <hi>Callias</hi> was very right, when he told me, I ſhould not read it without ſome diſorder in my ſelf: for how could I but be troubled, to perceive, that ſo great, and vertuous a Princeſſe, ſo much honored me in vain, by an
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56329:42"/>election of ſuch grace and favour, and did loſe her time, ſeeking that heart, which was already none of mine. As for <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> where the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which the Princeſs made me of her paſſion, ſhould in likelihood have cooled his, and made it leſſe, it in ſuch ſort increaſed it, and the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible ſenſe he had thereof, wrung from him ſuch complaints, and lamentations, as my heart was touched for him, and I could not chuſe, but that my tears would ſhew it: but when I ſaw, his grief had choak'd his ſpeech, and that with dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes which ſeem'd to crave my help, he turn'd towards me, I confeſſe that tenderneſs did blind me, Madam, and drew guilt upon me of a crime, which in your preſence I accuſe me of; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be ſin, to knit two ſouls by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means, which by Loves tyranny were ſet aſunder. Do not torment thy ſelf, dear <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> (ſaid I to him,) nor by thy woes, which ſlay me, caſt us headlong into one deſtruction, much had I rather, ſince thy remedy is in my power, than that thou ſhouldſt be more afflicted, hazard my honor for thy wellfare, which than life, has ever been to me more dear. Seeing thou canſt not then command thy paſſion, nor my ſelf obey that which the Princeſſe ſhews, I will chuſe rather to be falſe to her, than fail in duties of that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which I vowed thee from my infancy; but wherefore falſe, for ſure, I think I ſhall oblige her, if I ſend thee, to ſupply my room, and that ſhe cannot take offence: thou art, as I am, born a Prince, thy qualities exceed, and, where in me, ſhe thought to have made choice but of a Knight,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56329:43"/>thou wilt hereafter make her know, by telling what thou art, that by the gods allowance, and beyond her thoughts, ſhe ſhall have met her equal. Courage than <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> nothing is to be feared, in thy enterprize, ſave the beginning; and ſince ſhe lets me know, that <hi>Callias</hi> by the favour of the night muſt guide me, and that there ſhall no other torch enlight her chamber but what Love pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, thou mayſt without diſcovery paſſe in my room, and ſteal thee our again, before the day reveal thee. If in this counſel, I offend the gods, I hope they will forgive me, when they call to thought, that for thy ſafety and the Princeſſe life I have contriv'd it.</p>
               <p>Ah my dear <hi>Anaxander</hi> anſwered he, half wakened from his ſwounding, by my words, how is thy friendſhip helpfull? and the comfort thou adminiſtreſt, a dear and real proof, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love: but do not think thy honor is ingaged by the counſel thou doſt give me, nor that the fair <hi>Orixa,</hi> taking me for thee, can be abuſed, ſince I am certainly, thy other ſelf; and for like reaſon, do not think the fruits which I ſhall reap under thy name from her embraces, will be leſſe ſweet, or acceptable, than if I were received to her bed, as <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> or <hi>Cleontus.</hi> But, that in every thing, ſhe may not be deceiv'd, ſince <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> is to fetch an anſwer to her letter, let me have leave, to write it for thee, and that promiſing to come unto her, I may make it good.</p>
               <p>Madam, I granted his deſire, and let him write his letter in my Cloſet, which he had newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when as <hi>Callias</hi> came to take it from me, I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56329:43"/>told him, that he ſhould not fail to come to me at midnight, and that I would expect him in the door of my lodging, to be guided by him, where the Princeſſe had appointed, which ſecretly he promis'd me to do. But tis impoſſible to tell you her exceſſe of joy, when with a ſmiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, at his return he yielded her account of his ſo fortunate negotiation, but chieſly, when he gave her this deceitful teſtimony of my love, which thus was written.</p>

                        <hi>IF I have any cauſe to wonder at the honour you were pleas'd to do me, by the favour of your letter, tis rather through the meanneſs of my own deſerts, than any way the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of your words.

               <p>Thus <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> and the Princeſs, paſſed the reſt of that day in ſweet diſquiets for their amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous expectation, and when the night was come, <hi>Callias,</hi> whom I had promiſed to finde me in my door, and by a certain ſign exchanged by us, took <hi>Piroxenus</hi> in my ſtead; who only in his nightgown, followed his faithfull guide untill they came unto the foot of a Ladder made of Cords, and faſtned at <hi>Orixas</hi> Chamber window; and after notice taken by him of the places he had paſſed, that he might not, in returning, miſſe his way, <hi>Callias</hi> delivered him the key of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Garden, and ſo ſoftly took his leave of him. This happy Lover, who as yet proceeded in ſome trouble, for the fear he had of being known, was more than ever bold, when he perceiv'd the room was without light, and that he ſaw a hand out of the window making ſign to him to haſten up; which with incredible diligence he did, and found the Nurſe, who did receive him, in whoſe preſence, he caſt himſelf upon his knees before the Princeſſe bed; and after having kiſt her hand, and thankt her for the extream honour ſhe had done him, to elect him for her husband, he proteſted to her all the faith and perfect love, that could be thought on, and did tell her, that it may be ſhe would leſſe repent her, of her
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56329:44"/>choice, when ſhe ſhould know his birth.</p>
               <p>Here Madam you will pardon me if I omit to tell you, of the tranſports, and the ſweets of their embraces: for beſides, that manners may forbid me, how ſhould I well enough diſcribe a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which even he who taſted it, confeſt, he could not worthily enough expreſſe. I only think it fit to tell you, how that Love to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd upon them, for the ſweet deceipt they us'd towards him, was often on the point to kill them both with joy.</p>
               <p>They ſpent five or ſix nights in ſuch content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whiles <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> fearing to convert <hi>Orix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's</hi> love (which taking him for me ſhe witneſs'd to him,) into hatred, dar'd not tell her who he was. Mean time, my heart, which did aſpire but to your love, liv'd in continuall pain, and daily muſt my eyes belie it, and by ſtoln embraces, make the Princeſſe think, 'twas really my ſelf, that did enjoy her as her husband; I never for complacency, us'd ſo great art, and though I ſhould a thouſand times expoſe my life for <hi>Pirox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus,</hi> he could not ow me more, than for the part I play'd in <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> to advance his love, whiles my ſoul languiſht after you, and with impatience burnt to go my voyage to <hi>Narſingus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as impoſſible it is, that mans proſperity, and pleaſures, can laſt in one condition long, without diſturbances of fortune: it hapned, at the end of ten or twelve daies, that our poor Lovers were diſcover'd by a treaſon very ſtrange. <hi>Callias</hi> had uſed, ſince this ſecret imployment, often to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent our houſe; he play'd for much, and was
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56329:45"/>a man of wit enough, but of ſmall judgment, and leſſe courage. Now it fell out, that being on a time, at dice with <hi>Almerin,</hi> and <hi>Neander,</hi> who are thoſe two Gentlemen that went the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with us, they diſſred on a caſt, <hi>Callias</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi> which, as all truth of reaſon was, <hi>Neander</hi> (being third,) judg'd on his fellows ſide, at which, <hi>Callias</hi> who was arrogant, and of a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty humor at play, was moved in ſuch ſort, as he fell into inſolent, and injurious terms, and though ignoble, and of low deſcent he was, he fell into compariſons; Thou poor fellow, ſaid <hi>Almerin</hi> to him, if thou were out of my Maſters Lodgings, whom I honor, I would both kick thee, and pull out thy Tongue. My gallant ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſo ill handled, went away in great rage, and made complaint to a certain camrade of his, who was indeed a man of valour, that ſuch an affront was offred him, and pray'd his help to take revenge by killing his enemy. That young man, who would for nothing of the world have committed ſuch a baſeneſs, advis'd him to revenge himſelf in way of honor, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, that he would call <hi>Almerin</hi> to meet him with his ſword: which he was fain to accept, but notwithſtanding all the power he uſed on his cowardly diſpoſition, he never had the heart to meet him at the place appointed, for which his camrade, who had challeng'd <hi>Almerin,</hi> excus'd himſelf extreamly to him, and <hi>Neander</hi> alſo, who had ſerv'd as ſecond, proteſting whiles he liv'd, to have no more to do with ſuch companions.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Callias,</hi> who was ſtuck; as well the man
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56329:45"/>may be, that loſes honor, and good name, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving deadly vengance in his thoughts, but wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting boldneſs to perform it, thought at laſt, to uſe the power, he believ'd he had with me by reaſon of his truſt, and that undoubtedly he had my life &amp; honor in his hands, to make me put off <hi>Almerin;</hi> for this cauſe he came to me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing his quarrel, made me a long diſcourſe, which for troubling you I will not repeat, but iſſued from a great and notable ſubtility of wit, to make me underſtand that <hi>Almerin</hi> betrayed me; that he had diſcovered my Loves, and that it was expedient without more inquiry, to put him out or doors; I promis'd him to do it, but having learnt the paſſages betwixt them, I was far from giving <hi>Callias</hi> his deſire, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at his baſeneſs. I told not <hi>Piroxenus</hi> of it, for the fear I had of angring him, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my folly, not foreſeeing what misfortune might ariſe. This wicked man, ſeeing that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my promiſe to him, I had yet kept <hi>Almerin</hi> by me, enrag'd, to ſee himſelf diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored be thoſe, whoſe fortune, and whoſe credit he eſteem'd himſelf the author of, was ſo much troubled, and his anger ſo prevailed over him, as he went to Prince <hi>Demonax,</hi> whom he knew lov'd me not very well, and told him he was bound to reveal a ſecret to him, which concern'd the Crown: In a word, he told him, that almoſt every night, I lay as husband, by the Princeſſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rixa;</hi> and that after the matter was concluded between us, ſhe had made choice of him, for hee friend to relie on, how that he had ſeemed very
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56329:46"/>willing; but that he could not chuſe, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently come and give him notice of it; that it was very eaſie to ſurprize us in bed together, where he aſſured him, I came three, or four times a week, by a Ladder of ropes, faſtned at her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber window; He moreover, for ſecuring his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life, proteſted, that ſhe was no way acceſſary to that ſhameful act; He likewiſe did all he could, to palliate the Princeſs crime, and ſwore moſt horribly, to make the Prince believe I had ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her: but could not for all that, divert the tempeſt, which that night fell on her. For <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouax,</hi> who, though at the diſhonor of his houſe, was very glad to have that ſubject of revenge, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſiſter, whom he extremely hated, fail'd not to ſurprize them in bed together, conducted by perfidious <hi>Callias,</hi> who knocking at the door of the outward Chamber, where lay the Nurſe, he waked her, and having told her that he had ſome buſineſs of importance to her, the poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man opened it unto him, and was amaz'd, to fee the Prince come in with her ſon, and eight or ten men following him. Wonder not mother ſaid the traytor to her, Prince <hi>Demonax</hi> is adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of a diſorder which the Princeſs uſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he knows you are not guilty: deliver me the key of her Chamber, for he intends to finde her in bed with her minion. The Nurſe, more dead, than living, for thus ſeeing herſelf by her own ſon betrai'd, aplying herſelf to the Prince, Alas Sir ſaid ſhe, what can your ſiſter <hi>Orixa</hi> have done? nay, can you have any ill opinion of her honor? Sweet heart anſwered <hi>Demonax,</hi> be not you trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, I know you are free: give me but the key,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56329:46"/>and you ſhall ſee you are betray'd as well as we, and that my ſiſter hath diſhonored your grave conduct, as well as her own birth. <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> whoſe errant there, was not to ſleep, although they ſpake with voices low enough, heard a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed noiſe of words, and thought at firſt, the Nurſe was talking to ſome of the Princeſs wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were come it may be to watch with her in the outward Chamber: but when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they came neer the door, and that the key was put into the Lock. Ah Madam, cry'd he out, we are diſcover'd, we are betrayed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving the Princeſs leave to anſwer him, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his night Gown behinde him, which would but cumber him, beſides, that he had not the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to take it with him, he made but two ſprings from the bed to the window: and juſt when as his foot was on the firſt ſtop of the Ladder to ſave himſelf, <hi>Demonax</hi> came in, who ſeeing the poor Lover flying with incredible haſte: Take him, take the gallant, but take him alive, ſaid he, if poſſible, that juſtice may be done upon him. Preſently, three of them went to go down the Ladder, to obey the command; but <hi>Piroxenus</hi> who carried his ſword in his hand, had ſo much reaſon left him, as in going down, to cut as many of the rounds of the Ladder, as he could; in ſo much as thoſe who followed him finding no footing, fell from the top to the bottom; and had ſo ill ſpeed, as one of them burſt out his brains, and tother two ſo cruſht their bones, as that our Lover had good leaſure to get to his Lodging.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:56329:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Meanwhiles, <hi>Orixa</hi> was in wofull caſe. That moſt unhappy Lover, ſeeing herſelf ſurprized ſo, and no way able to deny an action, whereof there was ſuch teſtimony: being with ſhame confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and poſſeſt with horror, believing that her Nurſe had betrayed her, inſtead of replying to <hi>Demonax</hi> abuſes, and endeavouring to diſſwade him by entreaties, ſhe furiouſly beholding him, ſnatch'd at a Daggar by his ſide, &amp; having taken it, thou cruell Tiger, and unnatural, whom once I called Brother, I will glut thy rage, ſaid ſhe; and ſince the loſſe, thou think'ſt, my honor hath ſuſtain'd, muſt be accompanied with my lifes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe, I ſhall at leaſt have thus much comfort, that my own hands ſhall be my executioners: which ſaid, ſhe would have ſtab'd herſelf, but was prevented by the Prince, and thoſe of his company, whoſe power, ſhe was not able to reſiſt. That night therefore they kept her ſafe, during which time ſhe uttered complaints, which might have mov'd the moſt inhumane hearts; and I believe, the Prince himſelf, whatever hatred he had borne her, or purpoſe taken to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had ſure relented, if he had remaiued in the Chamber: But he retir'd, becauſe her tears ſhould not importune him, and in his perſon would take order for impriſoning <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> and left the ſorry Lady in the cuſtody of five or ſix, who gladly would have hazarded their lives for hers, if ſo their duties and their faiths would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them.</p>
               <p>The traytor <hi>Callias,</hi> had no mind to ſtay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; he too much fear'd the Princeſs accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56329:47"/>and his mothers curſes: that poor woman ſeeing her Miſtreſs in ſuch caſe, though ſhe were no way made a party in her crime, would yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her ſelf, and die with her, left being free, and her ſon author of the Treaſon, her ſidelity might be ſuſpected. Bind me, ſaid ſhe, to thoſe that kept her, I am as guilty as <hi>Orixa;</hi> and might it pleaſe the gods, the little life I have might ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for both our crimes: yea cannot ſpare me without cruelty, nor think I can out-live her life, who only is the cauſe I care to live. No Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no, ſaid one of them, <hi>Callias</hi> hath cleared you ſufficiently, and we perceive, what ere you ſay, proceeds from your affection to the Princeſs, &amp; your true feeling of her great misfortune. The Prince hath too great juſtice to entangle you in her miſchance, however you deſire to follow her. But notwithſtanding all their reaſons, ſhe was ſo reſolv'd to taint herſelf of guilt, by tearing off her hair, and knocking her breſt, as the unfortunate <hi>Orixa</hi> though ſo troubled, knew ſhe had no hand in that foul treachery, and that her ſon alone was author of it: ſhe therefore in her rage, had ſo much wiſedom, as not to deſtroy her, but beheld her with mixt eyes, of love, and fury. Then as an inſtant curſing her ill fortune, which had lead her to the puſh of loſing life, and honor both together, ſhe ſpake to thoſe that watched her, and with wrung hands, and watred eyes, conjured them, that if they had not heart enough, or rather piety, to kill her, they would at leaſtwiſe, ſuffer her own hands, to do that laſt act on her, and prevent thereby the ſhamfull death was threatned
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56329:48"/>her. When as ſhe ſaw ſhe obtain'd nothing, and that her begging drew no other iſſue from them, than their tears: refuſe me not however ſaid ſhe to them this requeſt, to tell me where my husband is, or what's become of him; that if he be in ſafety, I may dying have this conſolation, that I leave the ſweeteſt half of life behinde me. Whiles ſhe uttred thoſe complaints, they heard the languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voices of thoſe who had been lamed by their falls, and ſuddainly they ran to ſee, and found them in the miſerable caſe I mentioned, and one of them was dead, whom at firſt ſight they took for <hi>Piroxenus:</hi> but when they found he had ſaved himſelf, they went to acquaint the Prince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who taking me for the offender, preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets my Lodging, where he aſſur'd himſelf I was retir'd, as in truth <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> naked as he was had done; and indeed he much amazed me, when ſuddainly he brake my ſleep, and told me how his amorous robberies had been diſcovered; but ſaid he, becauſe they have not known me, you will be more concern'd than I, and I much fear leſt you be here ſurpriz'd, and may not have the time to juſtifie your ſelf. Save you then my dear <hi>Anaxander,</hi> for tis you alone they ſeek; and when you ſhall be ſafe, I will go tell the King my name, and ſave the Princeſs life, and honor, by preſenting him my ſelf, his ſon.</p>
               <p>I well liked his counſell, but alſo, ſcarce were my cloaths half on to execute it, when <hi>Demonax</hi> acompanied with a hundred of the Guard brake open my door; and without holding at my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, bound me and carried me to priſon, leaving
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56329:48"/>
                  <hi>Piroxenus</hi> free, who kept a tearing, and a raving without being underſtood. I was a hundred times about to tell them who I was, and how the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been carried: but I conſidered, that if they ſhould not give me credit (as no doubt is, but that a man to ſave his life will uſe a hundred ſlights) that beſides unprofitably I ſhould diſgrace my blood, I ſhould embroil my friend for whom I had been taken; ſo that becauſe I lov'd him better than my life, and valued his preſervation above my own, I freely confeſſed the crime, and was reſolved to die, not knowing how to hinder it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as it was day, the Princes went to tell the King, of this unhappy action, and preſently the noiſe of it ran through the City; I will not dwell here, Madam, on the ſorrows, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Queen, when ſhe knew the lamentable caſe to which her only daughter was reduc'd; that daughter, whom ſo dearly ſhe had loved, and whoſe vertue ſhe had had ſo many former proofs of. Surely ſhe with exceeding tears lamented the loſſe of her life, but much more griev'd ſhe for her wounded reputation.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile becauſe the crime which was but too certain, might not be long unpuniſhed, the King, relinquiſhing all fatherly affection, left his daughter to the Law, which did condemn her to be burnt alive, with him who was convicted for enticing her.</p>
               <p>The Pile was therefore fitted in the middle of the great place, which made all the inhabitants of <hi>Viſaporus</hi> tremble with horror; becauſe,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56329:49"/>though ſuch a Law had been a long time ſince eſtabliſhed, it never had been executed, but on her for whom it was firſt made, which was a ſiſter to one of their Kings, who had about threeſcore and ten years paſt been burnt, for falling in love with one of her Domeſticks, whom ſhe married ſecretly; and this was the firſt example they had ever ſeen; for that the other was ſo long ago, as that the eldeſt man among them ſcarce remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred it.</p>
               <p>Meanwhiles proviſion was a making for that wofull Tragedy, wherein <hi>Orixa</hi> and my ſelf were to be Actors; <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> who was not accuſed, and might if he pleas'd avoid all difficulties, not enduring I ſhould be expos'd to death, for an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Love, whereof himſelf alone was guilty, Went and caſt him down at the Kings feet, and there accus'd himſelf, as he who had ſeduc'd the Princeſs, and proteſted, that he was of Royall blood, and that he was both great, and rich e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to merit her, with multiplied oaths, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to perſwade him of my innocence. But the Kings trouble, and the rage that ruled him, admitted not his juſtifications, nor intreaties. He once knew well enough, that I was he whom the Princeſs had made choice of for her husband, and collecting by <hi>Piroxenus</hi> diſcourſe, that he had alſo got into her favours. What, how ſaid he, that Whore has not been ſatisfi'd with one, but given herſelf over to this other alſo, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage her luſt, there needs no other proof than his confeſſion, he condemns himſelf, let him be bound, and all three caſt into one fire.</p>

               <p>The Prince <hi>Arazus,</hi> who was neer him when be pronounc'd this ſentence, had ſtill unto that unfortunate day, maintain'd inviolable his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to us, which in ſeverall occaſions he had teſtifi'd; and, Madam, I confeſſe that being in ſuch favour with him, we did very ill, not to make known our ſelves unto that gentle Prince, who doubtleſs had ſhewn favour to my friends deſires, and liked the deſign of our exchange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Princeſs, who beſtowed her love on me in vain. But Heaven deny'd it, and <hi>Piroxenus</hi> ſtill was ſo reſpectfull of <hi>Orixa,</hi> and ſo fearfull of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleafing her, that notwithſtanding I perſwaded him, he dar'd never to declare himſelf, expecting alwayes that good office from me, who was in truth even ready to have done it, when as this miſchance ſurpris'd us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Araxus</hi> now, who lov'd us yet, and would have been glad that <hi>Piroxenus</hi> reaſons were found true, as well for what concern'd his Siſter, as his love to us, turned towards the King his eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying mercy, and compaſſion; and when hee would have ſpoken, not in our excuſe, but to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at leſt to have our execution deferred, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till tryall might be made, whether <hi>Piroxenus</hi> words were true or no.</p>
               <p>How ſaid the King, art thou ſo ſimple to believe, that thoſe, who have not wanted impudence to do me ſuch affronts, do want invention to coyn lies? if this bold man were born a Prince, would he not in wayes of honour have ſought for my alliance, and would he have ſo long remain'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, in a private quality, without ſo much
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56329:50"/>as making known himſelf, to her, whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth ſo perfidiouſly to have diſhonoured. No, no <hi>Araxus,</hi> I ſee thy ſiſter is a ſtrumpet, and that undoubtedly, thoſe two deceivers, are not the only men that have had knowledge of her.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, reply'd <hi>Araxus,</hi> you may pleaſe to conſider, that this man accuſes himſelf of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence as only Author of it, and willingly preſents himſelf to die to ſave his friend, whoſe innocence he offers to make good. O impudent man ſaid the King, who will defend a fellow taken in the manner; If he comes to accuſe himſelf, ſee'ſt thou not it is the juſt permiſſion of the Gods, who wrought ſo much his conſcience to remorſe, and will not have ſo fowle a crime unpuniſhed. Know <hi>Araxus,</hi> that the Conſcience is a marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing, and that for want of other witneſs it often ſhews it ſelf againſt our ſelves. Poor <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxenus</hi> looking pittifully upon <hi>Araxus,</hi> would again implore his aid, and make reply to the great wrong the King had done him; But that he had ſcarce opened his mouth, when the King tranſported with indignation; take the Impoſtor, ſaid he, from my preſence, and diſpatch him with the reſt.</p>
               <p>Then was he carried to a Priſon, till the hour of execution, and more tormented for my loſs than for his own; and when that mournfull time was come, (ſurely I ſhake for horror to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it,) before we parted from the Priſon, they read the ſentence of our condemnation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the Hangman took us, and all three were bound faſt in one Chariot, which was compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56329:50"/>about with Halberts, and other Officers of Juſtice, ſo conducted to the Pile, where, by that cruell. Element we were to be devour'd.</p>
               <p>For reconciling of our Conſciences, three of the ableſt <hi>Bramins</hi> of the <hi>Indes</hi> were allowed us. They did their duty in perſwading us to fit for death, aſſuring us the mercy of the Gods, and promiſing a thouſand ſpotleſs pleaſures after this life ended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> from the Priſon to the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, dared not once to turn towards us, nor to ſpeak one word, ſo much cauſe he found himſelf of our deſtruction: His ſorrows had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready even as much conſumed him, as if he had endur'd the flames, ſo much he griev'd, that 'twas not his power, by death to expiate a crime by him committed, and with his blood, redeem the loſs which he had caus'd, of thoſe he loved more than all the world.</p>
               <p>But ſurely, Madam, in ſo great extremity, I could not chuſe but wonder at <hi>Oriaxes</hi> courage, and her reſolution, who being ſtill abuſed with the belief ſhe had, I was her husband, not able, (being bound,) to caſt her arms about my neck, leaned her head upon my face to give me her laſt kiſs; and ſeeing that I ſhew'd but little joy at that her teſtimony of perfect love, which even in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe then gave me, and that the apprehenſion may be of the puniſhment might cauſe forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what I ought her: <hi>Taxilus,</hi> ſaid ſhe, to me, with a ſtrong voyce, and ſetled countenance, I ſwear by that ſame Sun that looks upon us, and which, we ſhortly ſhall behold more neer, in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56329:51"/>Heaven, that I am no way griev'd to die, ſince thou in death art my companion. One thing there is alone, that troubles me, and that, to ſee thee ſad, and that thy heart ſeems not to hold his wonted ſeat; can it fall out, that neer thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Orixa,</hi> thou ſhould'ſt fear death, which ought to be a pleaſing paſſage to a far more happy life? Let us, my <hi>Taxilus,</hi> out-brave our evil deſtiny, and take revenge on fortune, which does croſs our loves, by ſhewing her a courage able to make head againſt her, and a reſolution brave enough to undergo our evils.</p>
               <p>Fair <hi>Orixa,</hi> made I anſwer, I invoke even that ſame Sun, which you have call'd as witneſs of your courage, that my ſadneſs is not for the fear of death, but from the juſt affliction I endure, for having as I know abuſed you: Know you fair Princeſs, that in <hi>Taxilus</hi> you have loved an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, undeſerving, and perfidious man, who was not worthy of the honour, of ſo beautious and ſo brave a friendſhip, and that it is <hi>Cleontus</hi> who adores you, and whom the Gods have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for your husband: And as for me, behold me not in this ſmall bit of life that reſts us, but to ſay, I do forgive thee <hi>Taxilus,</hi> and may the Gods allow thy ſoul to reſt in peace with us.</p>
               <p>The poor Princeſs, who was praepoſſeſt with that ſtrong imagination, that on me ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed her embraced, marvelouſly ſtrucken at the change, and that of love there came not one word from me; Ah Cruell, ſaid ſhe, that in the caſe thou art, ſo neer to yeeld the Gods a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of thy actions, doeſt not apprehend their
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56329:51"/>juſtice? thou miſerable, doſt thou then now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me, becauſe thou canſt no longer have me? wilt thou by ſcorn revenge thy death, which my love cauſes thee? Ah how ill doth this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs become thy ſex, to leave me in extremity, as if 'twere ſin agaiſt the Gods, to love a maid that is unfortunate? Can thoſe be the effects of all thy promiſes, and of thy faith, which thou ſo oft haſt ſworn me: thou ſhould'ſt, ſomuch have reverenc'd the memory of thy faithfull <hi>Orixa,</hi> as to have lov'd her after death, and have preſerv'd for ever, her <hi>Idea</hi> in thy heart; but ſee, thou giv'ſt her to another, when ſhe can be thine no longer, and for a recompence of that incomparable love which made her hold thee deerer than her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or her life, thou wilt not ſuffer her to dye in patience: Thou art not barely pleas'd, to take the only comfort from me, which, I dying, had to flatter my ſelf with, of thy pure conſtancy, but wilt accuſe thy ſelf of treachery, and want of faith, to kill my conſtancy, and reſolution, that in deep deſpair I may depart this life.</p>
               <p>I would have ſpoken, to have diſpoſſeſt her of that hard belief, and pacifie her thoughts; but that I ſcarce had uttered the firſt word, to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my ſelf, when with a fiercer, and a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed voice, preventing me: No, no, thou hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, ſaid ſhe, thou double-hearied, thankleſs, and forſworn <hi>Taxilus,</hi> thou art induſtrious, at the price of innocent <hi>Cleontus</hi> life, whom, moſt injuſtly thou accuſeſt, to preſerve thine own: I call the Gods to witneſs, that he never knew me, and that thy ſelf, art only guilty of the crime, for

Thou, may be, thinkeſt, that thoſe holy men who hear us, may by thy lies, be drawn to credit thee; and when thou baſely baſt turn'd all the fault upon thy harmleſs friend, who maketh no defence, thinkſt to be free. But though they were ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous as to believe thy words, and that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, (which the gods forbid) that thou ſhouldſt ſcape the hangmans hands, I vow thou ſhouldſt not ſave thy ſelf from mine; and if before I die I had not leave to ſtrangle thee, my ghoſt ſhall never leave to haunt thee.</p>
               <p>More ſhe would have ſaid, but that her ſorrow, and her rage, made her inſenſible; her eyes and judgement ſtrayed, and her heart and voice, at once did fall her in the paſſions of her anger.</p>

               <p>I would not trouble my ſelf to give him any anſwer, becauſe it could avail me nothing, I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed him where he conducted me, and we

But long they were not without newes from her which they thought had carryed you away; for ſhe was ſcarce gone out of the Gulf of <hi>Cambaye,</hi> to enter into the great <hi>Arabique</hi> Sea, when threatned by a tempeſt, and finding her ſelf neer the Heaven of <hi>Bazaim,</hi> which is one of the ſecureſt of that ſhore, the Pilots thought it fit to caſt Anchor there, and ſhelter themſelves ſo long, as till the ſtorm were over. This ſtay gave opportunity to that Poſt, who had been ſent from <hi>Campanel</hi> to <hi>Bazaim,</hi> to ſend out a Ship, to meet that ſame which had put all the Court in trouble: But when it was known, that you were not therein; rage in the King, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſt ſo much, and the Levity of your flight, touch'd him ſo to the quick, as all the love he bare ye, he turn'd to hate and indignation.

               <p>As ſoon as we were come into the Queens Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, the King caus'd <hi>Pirobus</hi> to come unto him, who had negotiated his laſt marriage with that fair Princeſs, who brought you into the world, and who had alwayes ſerved him ſo faithfully; And ſure I was exceedingly amazed, when tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Queen, he made her in our preſence this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Madam, (ſaid he to her,) I know the ſorrow you conceive for your Sons Levity is ſo great, as that to underſtand he were no more alive, would no more grieve you, than his ſlight: wherefore, becauſe it cannot add a jot unto your preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, I intend to tell you of a thing which does exceedingly concern me, and which theſe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years I have conceal'd from all the world, and moſt eſpecially from you.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:56329:58"/>
               <p>You may remember, Madam, when firſt I ſent you <hi>Pirobus</hi> in Embaſſage, to ſeek you for my wife, you, after having courteouſly received him, gave him an anſwer ſomewhat cold, by framing an excuſe touching your brothers death, <hi>(Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus,)</hi> who becauſe he had been dead two years before, finding that reaſon inſufficient to oppoſe my juſt demand, he was deſirous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him better in your truer meanings, and underſtood by one of your chief States-men, that the ſole conſideration which you ſtuck on, was, that by the Queen <hi>Bereniſa,</hi> my firſt wife, I had a Son; and that my heir already born, you would not ſuffer that your Children, ſhould be ſecond in affection, or degree to any: This being return'd me by my faithfull <hi>Pirobus,</hi> I ſeem'd to take no notice of it: but after ſome time was paſt, wee both agree'd together, that if I meant to compaſs my deſire in that ſute, where-on depended all my happineſs, I muſt needs ſend away, my Son, and ſpread a noyſe that he was dead. And judge you, Madam, to what extremity I loved you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compell'd to take ſo contrary a reſolution to the lawes of nature. For this cauſe, I comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Coffin to be laid (with Royall pomp) into the earth, and ſuffered none, in forty dayes to ſee me, that I might better act the part of a loſt Father. Mean while I gave my Son in charge to <hi>Pirobus,</hi> whoſe name was like mine own, <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daris,</hi> not to be ſent ſo far away, but that I might, when I deſir'd, hear often of him. He had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with an <hi>Arabian</hi> Merchant, and an honeſt man, named <hi>Eurimedes,</hi> who was moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56329:58"/>in the City of <hi>Deu,</hi> one of the beſt havens of my Kingdom, and teaded to <hi>Cambaye,</hi> where at that time he was. To him he went, and gave that pledge into his cuſtody, which for your love I had abandoned; He told the Merchant, how he had receiv'd that child from a woman of great quality, commended him to his beſt cate, and that he might be bred among his own, and told him, one day it m ight happen, that a worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence might grow unto him; In the inferior, becauſe he might be known again, and for he had no mark about him, <hi>Pirobus</hi> made one upon his arm, where he imprinted the Arms of <hi>Cambaye</hi> with a needles point, and the joyce of a certain herb wch never wears away; which done, he does again commend him to the Merchant, whom, that he might the better love the child, and be more carefull of him, he enjoyned to beſlow his own name of <hi>Eurimedes</hi> upon him; In ſo much, as very often I have heard of him, &amp; alſo known the Merchants care, as well for the great p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But Madam, (ſaid the King moreover,) the Gods can bear me witneſs, I had tane your deer <hi>Anaxander</hi> into ſo great affection, as I forgot the love I ought his Brother; and if he had well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himſelf, I think, his humor, which beyond all others that I know, delighted me, together with my wonderfull affection to your ſelf, had ſo much won upon me, as I had made him heir to all my three Crowns: but ſeeing he hath ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56329:59"/>ſo giddy-headed, and ſo ill adviſed, as to leave me, to purſue his fooliſh fantaſies, as well as his Couſin, whom ſo deerly I had loved, having no other prop to reſt on, left me; Think not a miſs, Madam, that I ſend <hi>Pirobus</hi> to <hi>Diu,</hi> to ſeek me out <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> 'tis now no longer fit, he ſhould be hid, nor that on my part, I ſhould more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the love I bear my proper Son.</p>
               <p>Theſe, my deer children, ſaid <hi>Evander,</hi> are the very words the King himſelf delivered, who, without alteration at the Queens complaints, and tears, diſpatched <hi>Pirobus</hi> immediately. Being ariv'd at <hi>Diu,</hi> he wonderfully amazed the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, when he told him that ye child whom he ſo long had bred, was heir unto the King; The noiſe hereof was ſpread incontinently through the City, and all the inhabitants came in throngs to kiſſe their Princes hands. <hi>Pirobus</hi> who had not ſeen him, ſince his firſt delivery into the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants hands, could know him only by the mark he graved on his arm. The young man more than any other grew in admiration at the honors which were done him: For he believ'd, he was that Merchants ſon, and look'd for nothing leſſe, than to be honor'd as a Prince.</p>
               <p>He was by <hi>Pirobus</hi> conducted to the City of <hi>Campanel,</hi> and carried both the Merchant and his children with him, on whom he afterward caus'd goodly Offices to be conferred. As ſoon as his arrival was but known, the greateſt of the Court went forth to meet him, and the King with teſtimonies of exceeding joy received him, but this did not long endure: For that young
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56329:59"/>Prince was ſo ill bred, and had among thoſe people of inferiour quality who had kept him, gotten ſuch evill habits, as that his preſence ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but to make you more lamented; but above all, the Queen could not endure, that in your ſtead, a beaſt ſhould have ſuch worſhip, who by his filthy carriage, had made himſelf contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all the world.</p>
               <p>The King commanded me to take him to my Government: But finding in him no appearance of common ſenſe, and ſeeing him too old to form his mind to any good; I did deſpair ever to make of him a civill man; and you may think my dear children, whether I finding in that poor Prince ſpirit, nothing but thornes and briers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of goodly ſeeds of vertue, which I found in you, I had great cauſe to be delighted with my charge.</p>
               <p>The King, who in that ill made Picture, could not know himſelf, made <hi>Pirobus</hi> a thouſand times to ſwear he was the ſame which he had from him.

               <p>See Madam, what diſcourſe <hi>Evander</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd us with, which ſet my thoughts into as great confuſion, as they were but two hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for I believ'd I was <hi>Alcidaris</hi> his only ſon, and much it angred me, a fool ſhould be my elder brother: However I cheer'd up my ſelf; in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56329:60"/>hope or one day having the fair Kingdom of <hi>Dulcinda,</hi> which could not be taken from me. And however, I deſpaired not of gaining others, which my courage, and my ſword did promiſe me.</p>
               <p>But as on our parts we were recounting our adventures to the wiſe <hi>Evander,</hi> who much bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us (after having told him of <hi>Orixas</hi> loves, and the change we us'd towards her) for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing our ſelves to the Prince <hi>Araxus;</hi> a Page came to advertiſe us, the King was comming to ſee us in our Chamber: I was a little ſurprized at it, becauſe I foreſaw already what would be the iſſue of that viſit: However <hi>Piroxenus</hi> and I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our ſelves as well as we could, we went forth to meet him; and after mutuall ſalutations, he began, and thus ſaid to me.</p>
               <p>I much admire, Sir, that being born as you are, and for our neighbourhood, knowing my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and my Lordſhip of the famous Potts of <hi>Chaul,</hi> and <hi>Goa,</hi> which adjoyn to yours, you would chuſe rather death, than my alliance, when you had firſt abuſed my daughter, who had been alwaies till your comming hither, the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, both of honor, and of vertue.</p>
               <p>I finding his diſcourſe grew to be long, and that he went on reproaching me, and excuſing himſelf for the violence had been ſhewen us, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly interrupted him, to tell him every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that paſſed; I told him of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate affection <hi>Piroxenus</hi> bare the Princeſs his daughter; how that he was my Conzin germain, and the only heir unto the Kingdom of <hi>Citor;</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:56329:61"/>how he had borne ſo great reſpect unto her, as not to dare declare himſelf her husband, though never any ſave hithſelf had known her; how when he ſaw things grown to ſuch extremity as they were, and me condemned for his fault, he went and caſt himſelf at his Majeſties feet, who would not hear him: At length, I ſo far perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, as having appear'd his ſpirit, and freed him from the trouble which his former rage had put him in, he reliſhed my reaſons, which he found moſt juſt and likely; and taking us by the hand, that he might ſuddenly finiſh <hi>Piroxenus</hi> Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, he lead us to the Princeſs Chamber, who was very ſick a bed, and by her, ſat the Queen in tears.</p>

               <p>Seeing me come into her Chamber, and the King her father leading me by the hand, believing he was come to confirm our Marriage, and that it had been done more through compaſſion of her friends, than of my own good will; the tears ran in her eyes, and to conceal the paſſion which ſurprized her, ſhe turn'd her head the other ſide.</p>
               <p>My daughter, ſaid King <hi>Demonax</hi> unto her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your husband whom I bring you; and

               <p>Here at the Princeſs turn'd her face towards the King, and ſeeing it twas <hi>Piroxenus</hi> he preſented her; How Sir, ſaid ſhe to him, that impoſtor then is conſtant in denying me, after renouncing of himſelf to quite undo me; and you believe him? and I ſhall be ſo miſerable, as that you will put off your common knowledge to be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

               <p>Madam, ſaid he, though you ſhould heap your ſcorns upon me, and all my life I ſhould repent me of my raſhneſs, yet I finde fit I ſhould no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hide it from you, but make known the errour, you till now have been in.

Love, (fair <hi>Orixa</hi>) made me bold to deceive you, blame therefore him, not me, who weak againſt ſo ſtrong a Maſter, was compelled to yield, and follow him. Twas I whom <hi>Callias</hi> under favour of the darkneſs guided, where you look'd for <hi>Anaxan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> and in ſhort, twas I, who in your Nurſes preſence, ſware to be your lawfull husband, and who made you a thouſand proteſtations of unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Love, which ſince I'me ſure I never vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; the fear of death has not been able to do

               <p>The Princeſs heard him with attention, and although the dolors of her Feavor were of power enough to take away the liberty of talk, ſhe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, would have forc'd herſelf to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, when by the comming of a Poſt ſhe was prevented, who after boldly knocking at the door demanded entrance, and admittance to the King for reaſons of a high importance, the King commanded him to be brought to him; and truly at firſt entrance he affrighted the whole company, and ere he ſpake his countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrai'd, that all things went not as they ſhould.

               <p>You may imagine, fair Princeſs, whether ſuch an humor as I have deſcrib'd the Kings to be, were ſurprized with ſuch news. He could not hide his apprehenſion from us, a deadly paleneſs disfigured his face; and not finding himſelf able enough to reſiſt a misfortune which ſo neerly threatned him, he could not ſpeak a word, when as <hi>Araxus,</hi> who knew his very heart, aſhamed we were witneſſes of ſo much poverty, withdrew him from thence, and told him, twas his way to call his Councill together, and ſuddainly provide againſt the preſent neceſſities.

               <p>A midſt the trouble which this miſerable King was in, he called us into his counſel of War, and crav'd our help; but we repreſented to him the impoſſibility thereof, and that there remaining unto him no other retreait but that only City, from whence he was ready to be driven by thoſe, who ſought but for his life, to reign without contradiction, we ſhould not be able to bring any ſuccours, though they lay but ſix daies jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney off, and though we found them ready for the march. And what then, ſaid he to us, muſt I loſe all my hope, and that my children and my ſelf be brought to ſo cruell a neceſſity, as to die, or live for ever under the power of baſe ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels? By and by he caſt out divers blaſphemies againſt the gods, and inſtantly, caus'd all the childrens throats to be cut, which he receiv'd as Hoſtages from thoſe ſlaves.</p>
               <p>Verily, Madam, we ſaw not how to give him great comfort, becauſe we found his matters in a deſparate condition; However we made a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of neceſſity, and joyned the Princes, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and we, together with as many Naires, as there were in the Kings Guard, all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Viſaporus</hi> which were of age to bear Arms, to try if we could raiſe a power, able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do ſome dammage to our enemies; but they conſiſted of ſo great a number, as we

               <p>Meanwhile they laid their Batteries againſt the City, and it was threatned by a quick aſſault, when the King fearing to fall under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This perſidious <hi>Panaris,</hi> ſeeing no way of ſafety for himſelf, or Maſter, being to croſſe the Camps, miſchievpuſly conceived in his heart, to kill the King, and take his Jewels, which doubtleſſe would remain as reward to him, when he ſhould carry his head to his enemies. This purpoſe was no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on, but put in execution, for when that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56329:65"/>poor Prince thought of nothing leſſe than Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from his ſervant, he was thrown to ground by a thruſt made through and through his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and having cut off his head, he carried it to <hi>Rozalcan,</hi> who was encamped towards the River. Notwithſtanding he was a barbarous man, and ſought nothing but the death of the King, and his children, yet could not that action chuſe but fright him: however he put not the traytor to death, but after having taken his riches from him, was only pleaſed to forbid him his preſence, and no more. He preſently advertiſed his brother <hi>Zabain</hi> of what had paſſed, and they thought good to advertiſe the beſieged by a Trumpet, of the Kings death, that they might be the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned, promiſing them, that if the Souldiers would render themſelves, they ſhould depart with bag and baggage, without any hurt done them, and as for the inhabitants of the City, they ſhould quoitly enjoy their lands and houſes, on this condition alwaies, that they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Princes, <hi>Araxus,</hi> and <hi>Demonax,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands.</p>
               <p>The people of that poor diſtreſſed City, were ſo moved at the news of the Kings death, who had ſo long a time maintained them in peace, as without conſidering what became of themſelves, ſeeing they yet demanded the Princes of them, to put them cruelly to the ſword likewiſe, fell ſo furiouſly upon the Trumpeter, as in an inſtant they had cruſht him, and their rage was ſo great, as they diſmembred him with their teeth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one would have a plece.

               <p>Meanwhile the Princeſs <hi>Orixa,</hi> knew not any thing of theſe misfortunes, and had already theſe two daies loſt all manner of underſtanding, and ſo great was the ſtrength of her diſeaſe, as taking from her all appearances of life, ſhe who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her came to advertiſe us how ſhe had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her mother. <hi>Orazia</hi> exceedingly moved at this concluſion, which ſhe looked ſhould not be ſo Tragical, Ah, ſaid ſhe to the Prince, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, the poor <hi>Orixa</hi> then is dead; truly ſhe ſhould not have dyed, after having paſt ſo many troubles.

               <p>Beſides theſe reaſons, I adminiſtred ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I ſomewhat ſetled his mind, but not being able longer to remain in that ſad place, which had been a theatre unto us of ſo many miſchiefs, grief and affliction which had rul'd his heart, gave wrath, and vengeance, at one inſtant full poſſeſſion: Lets forth, lets forth <hi>Anaxander,</hi> ſaid he, out of this unfortunate City, which even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frights me; ſtay we not till the enemies do force it, and be taken among thoſe who muſt give up themſelves unto the mercy of barbarians; let us revenge the Royall blood of <hi>Decan,</hi> and with the choyce of all the brave, and valiant men among us, powre upon thoſe Traytors, and if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſcape their hands, lets at dear rates ſell our lives, and gloriouſly expire; my blood already boyles with anger in me, and I perſwade my ſelf, that raſcall rout cannot reſiſt my ſury.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:56329:67"/>
               <p>I had already made the ſame overture to the Princes, and told them 'twas the only way which they could try to ſave themſelves, ſeeing how true it was, they ſought but for their lives, and therefore found it no hard matter, to perſwade their reſolutions thereunto. We therefore pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to aſſemble only two or three thouſand of the beſt and ableſt men of the City, to make a fully by night upon the enemies out at the Port of <hi>Goa,</hi> where they wre with leaſt ſtrength en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched; But when the <hi>Viſaporians</hi> knew their Princes went in perſon, they would all go, and left to guard their walls, women, and children only, and old men, among the which was ſage <hi>Evander,</hi> to whom, what ever good or evill might become of us, we bid farewell, deſiring him that if he could get out from thence, he would return to <hi>Cambaye;</hi> and that he would endevour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>Alcidaris</hi> his favour to us, whom we aſſur'd him we would ſee as ſoon as we had ſeen a little of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> in caſe the Gods preſerv'd us in the hazard we were falling into; he therefore with all poſſible regret imbraced us, becauſe he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he never more ſhould ſee us, and much ado we had, to change his wilfull purpoſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company us in that ſally.</p>
               <p>The Princes had deſign'd to follow us, and go the voyage to <hi>Narſinga</hi> with us, if we could ſcape out of the multitude, and for that cauſe we took for rendezvous, an old decayed Temple, which lies upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56329:67"/>enemy, both brothers after great and worthy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their valour by them done, were ſlain at our fees. As for our ſelves Madam, we hew'd our way through thoſe that followed us, and ſlew what ever from that ſide oppoſed us. The Moon was lightſome, and heaven ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured us, that <hi>Pirox nus</hi> and I ſound our ſelves neer to one another, and but lightly hurt, poor <hi>Neander</hi> was wounded with a dart in his thigh, and was carried back into the City, ready to die, that we muſt go without him, and <hi>Almerin</hi> who loſt not ſight of us, purſued us, when we had given <hi>Neande</hi> charge, and ſome other of our Souldiers, to ſpread a moyſe, that we were ſlain with the twoi Princes, leſt we might draw a blame upon us, for forſaking the beſieged. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſecretly with-drew our ſelves elſe where, not willing to be witneſſes of that poor Cities mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, which could not long hold our, and which by the loſſe of thoſe two Princes, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other reaſons had oblieg'd us to that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, had loſt her finall hope. Three things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we went, we recommended to <hi>Neander:</hi> the firſt was, that he ſhould not fail to cauſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>Demonax,</hi> and <hi>Araxus,</hi> to be buried in their Fathers grave, and that he likewiſe ſhould be carefull of interring the Princeſs <hi>Orixa</hi> their Siſter. The ſecond was, that notwithſtanding he was hurt, he ſhould not leave the poor beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, who did already want proviſion, and that he ſhould aſſiſt them to make as honourable compoſition as he could; a thing which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed held far unfit for us, and which to farther,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56329:68"/>the great ſervice they had newly done, would much import. And thirdly, that he ſhould help all he could, the good <hi>Evander</hi> to return unto <hi>Cambaye,</hi> and aſſure him of our ſafeties; that as for him, as ſoon as he were whole, he ſhould not fail to come unto us, and that he ſhould hear of us in the King of <hi>Narſinga</hi>'s Court, under the names of <hi>Ariomant,</hi> and <hi>Caliſtenus,</hi> for fear we might be known by thoſe of <hi>Taxilus,</hi> and <hi>Cleon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and we had given the ſame directions to the good <hi>Evander,</hi> before we parted from him.</p>
               <p>Thus, Madam, left we that unfortunate City, and I muſt confeſs the willingneſs wherewith <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxenus</hi> followed me, without deſpair, is not the ſmalleſt argument of that extreme affection which he bears me. The Image of that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Princeſs preſented it ſelf evermore before his eyes, he had no other pleaſure than to afflict himſelf, with the remembrance of her death. That was the ſole meditation of his dayes, the only dream of his nights, and the continuall trouble of his ſoul; and yet among ſo many peircing griefs, and bloody diſcontentments, hee compell'd himſelf to live to bear me company. We then, put off our Arms, and <hi>Almerin,</hi> who knew full well the Countrey, made us go that night on foot as then we were, &amp; brought us to a little City named <hi>Foya,</hi> ſome four Leagues off from <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> upon the rode to <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew that none of <hi>Roſalcans</hi> Troops lay on that quarter. We found there the inhabitants quite loſt, and vext with fear, not knowing of which ſide to be, not where to rank themſelves;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56329:68"/>however, after having taught them, that they muſt give place to force, that all their Princes were dead, and that their great City was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with approaching ruin, we, after we were furniſhed with horſes, and what elſe we wanted, for our money, left them reſolv'd to ſend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the two uſurpers. The wounds we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, did not hinder us from proceeding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and therefore we went right to <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> well provided both of Money and Jewels, to rub through ſuch extremities as might befall us. I will not ſpend my time (Madam) in relating you all the adventures w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we met on the way, for fear of abuſing your patience, I will only mention that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> gave me the honour of your acquaintance, &amp; which was the reaſon, why at firſt we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived happily into the King your fathers Palace.</p>
               <p>When we were come within two Leapues of that great City of <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> where we had learn'd the King made then his ſix moneths reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, paſſing along by a Foreſt of Palm Trees, in the middle of the rode, which leadeth ſtrait to the City, we ſpied a hunter of a goodly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and richly clad, who being mounted on a horſe, as ſwift as was the beaſt he followed, had left his fellow hunters far behind him. Scarce had he paſſed us an hundred paces, ruſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the thick, without more train, than one page only, who never left him, but that a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Robbers who had lain in ambuſh in a thicket by the which he paſſed, caſt themſelves ſuddainly upon him, and held his reigns to ſtop his paſſage, ere he ſcarce perceived them; As ſoon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56329:69"/>as he had found himſelf infeſted with this raſcall rout, nimble and active as he was, he flung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of his ſaddle, to the ground, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his ſword, cleaved his head who firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borded him; but ſeeing that hismatch was too hardly made, and that he muſt at length be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, he was reſolv'd to ſell his life full dear. By good luck, as he paſſed, we were turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout towards him, and his rich furniture, cauſed that curioſity in us, and was the means, that even about the very inſtant we perceiv'd him in this trouble, we ran unto him haſtily, and found the Page thrown to the ground by a hurt in his thigh, and the hunter, ſorely wounded, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet his back againſt a tree, did moſt couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly defend himſelf. The aid we lent him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled his courage, and by good luck for us, it chanced that in leſs than half an hour, <hi>Piroxenus, Almerin</hi> and my ſelf, ſet him at liberty, and ſlew all thoſe Rogues, excepting two, that had aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; which two, hurt as they were, were bound and carryed to the City: 'twas not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſore hurts that we perform'd that task, and if the Page had not remembred to wind his horn, to call the hunters to that place, who were behind, we had run all of us an hazard to have loſt our lives by reaſon of the blood which ſtreamed in abundance from our wounds. As ſoon as the brave hunter found himſelf delivered from that danger, which he never thought to eſcape: Ye Knights, ſaid he, what ever ye may be, that have ſo happily come hither, know, 'tis the Prince <hi>Arontkus</hi> whom ye have ſaved from the ambuſh
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56329:69"/>of thoſe theeves, and is your debtor for his life, and therefore, whether ye be ſubjects to the King my Father, or elſe ſtrangers to this Countrey, I promiſe ye, this reall ſervice ſhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledged, neither ſhall ye ask me any thing to be deni'd. I preſently made anſwer in the Arabique tongue, that we were Perſian Knights, and had reſolved to travel through all <hi>India,</hi> that we had unknowing him, done him that ſmall ſervice, but as honor, and reaſon both obliged us; But ſeeing now he had declar'd his name, however grievous our wounds were, we held our ſelves moſt highly honor'd to receive them for his ſake, and would not waill our lives, were we at point of loſing them, ſince for his preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were ſpent. He hereat us'd his beſt ſtrength to embrace us, (for he underſtood the Arabique tongue as well as we did his) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting he would never be unthankfull for ſo great a benefit, urg'd us to make him ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which whatſoever it were, within the King of <hi>Narſinga's</hi> power, he would grant us. But that which moſt won on his heart, and doubled his affection to us, was the anſwer which we made him; that we already held our ſelves too high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompenced, in as much as our weak help was ſo acceptable unto him; but that we might not take from him, the pleaſure of ſhewing his brave heart towards us, all the favour we deſired, was, that he would cauſe us to be well accepted in the King his fathers Court, which from far off, we came to ſee, as moſt renowned in all <hi>Aſia,</hi> not only for the courage and the freedom of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56329:70"/>Knights thereof, but alſo for the courteſie and beauty of its Ladies. Truly ſaid he, I do aſſure your wellcome as mine own, and if the gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that among us, there any pleaſure be, that may detain ye, and that any place, or charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the King there be that may become ye, ye ſhall know the love <hi>Aronthus</hi> bears ye.</p>
               <p>Whileſt we were on theſe Complements, the Huntſmen, and the Prince your brothers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came where the horn had called them, they were in great amazement to ſee their Maſter in ſuch caſe, and altogether confounded with ſhame, dared not come neer him, fearing le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t the blame of that had hapned to him, he might lay upon the little care they had to follow him: But on the contrary, the generous <hi>Aronthus,</hi> whoſe apprehenſions evermore inclin'd to ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and never ſeen to be in angry, ſpake to them without any trouble, and preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to have a care of us, and him. Relieve ſaid he, my friends, ſuccour thoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and generous Knights, who have now newly ſav'd my life, and are in danger of their own. The Chirurgian, and the reſt fell inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about their buſineſs, and finding, that the Prince was more hurt than we, dreſt him firſt, though he forbad him, and though they found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him ſeven, or eight cruell wounds, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them mortall, no more than ours; They made the beſt uſe they could in that neceſſity of any thing to caſe us, and fit litters for us, and whiles we were conveighing into the City, we underſtood from thoſe Raſcalls which were
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56329:70"/>ſcap'd alive, to pay the debt they ought to Juſtice, that thoſe thieves which had ſet upon the Prince, were companions to one <hi>Tamurchand,</hi> the moſt famous robber of the <hi>Indes,</hi> who with thoſe graceleſs rakehels, retir'd himſelf into the moſt fearfull ſolitude of the Mountains of <hi>Gate;</hi> and becauſe three or four daies before he had ſuffied and was hang'd and quartred in the great place of <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> thoſe raskcals had projected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their Caprains death, upon the Princes perſon, or the King himſelf, whom they would entrape amid their chaſe a hunting; and ſure they had not made ill bargain with <hi>Arontus,</hi> if ſo the gods had not been pleas'd, to ſend us early to his ſuccour.</p>
               <p>I cry you mercy, Madam, if in the heat of my diſcourſe, I repeat you things that you have ſeen, and know as well as I, I couldnot forget the occaſion, that gave me the honor of ſeeing you, and making me acceptable in your ſight, and as often as you ſhall pleaſe to give me the freedom of diſcourſing to you, I think I ſhall ſtill enterlace it with this ſtory.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56329:71"/>Picture, which inanimate, and dead as it was, had raviſht me at <hi>Gouzarate,</hi> and whoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea I had alwaies ſo dearly preſerved in my heart, I had much to do to hinder that I died not for joy; my wounds opened at my ſurprizall by that pleaſure unexpected, and the ſudden weakneſſe which I felt at the loſſe of my blood; If you remember, Madam, I amazed all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but more your ſelf than any, be it, you felt your ſelf as guilty of my ſouls diſorders, or whether you already would account your ſelf concern'd in my paſſions. From that inſtant I perceived, that you rejected not the offers which my eyes made you of my ſervice, and if my quality had been but known unto you, I believe you would have been more bold, to give me from that preſent, proofs of your affection, &amp; good will unto me. I forbare not, for all I was unknown, as ſoon as I felt my ſelf well cured of my wounds, to venture ſo far as to let you know thoſe of my heart, which I believed would not be ſo quickly healed; I flattered my ſelf with this belief, that you deſpiſed not my complements, and love in ſuch ſort blinded me, as I perſwaded me, you would not ſcorn my Letters, if I took ſo much freedome as to write unto you. I doubt me, Madam, whether it be true that <hi>Almerin</hi> told me, that you received that which I ſent by him, with I know not what kinde of obliging neglect, which made him know you diſapprov'd my raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but condemn'd it not; that you counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much anger with me, and him alſo, who had brought you the news of my Love; but that you
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56329:71"/>forbare not however to read my Letter, which with a feigned action of diſdaign, you opened, and preſently gave him back again, without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought elſe to him, than, Go tell thy Maſter, that his too great boldneſs does not pleaſe me, and bid him call to mind I am the daughter of a King: But Sir, ſaid <hi>Almerin,</hi> at the recitall which he made of that adventure; Aſſure your ſelf the fair <hi>Orazia</hi> loves you, ſhe could not hide from me the leaſt thought of her heart, her eyes reveal'd her moſt ſecret purpoſes, and though they had been ſhut up too, as was her mouth, I ſhould have found that love was mixed with that blood, which came ſo often up into her cheeks.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs very well remembring, with what innocency that action had paſſed, when ſhe had counterfeited anger againſt <hi>Almerin,</hi> and that, with indeed a feigned anger ſhe had opened that letter, which ſhe had a mind to ſee, becauſe to ſay truth ſhe even at that time burnt for love of <hi>Anaxauder,</hi> ſhe could not chuſe but laugh, and bluſh at once; and the Prince <hi>Anaxander</hi> being by that natural ſhamefaſtneſs ſufficiently aſſured of the truth thereof, proceeded thus in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>You have known all Madam, ſaid he, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath ſince paſſed in that Court, and that as well, which does concern my love, as that which toucheth <hi>Piroxenus</hi> melancholy, who would be hardly ſeen in any company, and cloathed in a long and mourning habit, which yet more his heart put on, did plant a grief and ſorrow in the minds of all that ſaw him. You
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56329:72"/>ſaw, how notwithſtanding the moſt ſtrong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands given by the King your father againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Combates, whereunto thoſe of this Kingdom more than all I know, are moſt addicted, and which, but yeſterday with ſo much earneſtneſſe was reinforced, I ſlew that proud <hi>Lerian,</hi> who, through his jealouſie of the extraordinary favors I received from the generous <hi>Aronthus,</hi> chalenged me, who thought, I had diverted from him, thoſe affections he pretended to deſerve: and how after that Combate I had enough to do, to ſave me from the rigor of the Law, if the Prince your brother had not engag'd himſelf, in my affairs, and urg'd the ſervice I had done him. You have I ſay, ſeen all theſe things Madam, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which I cannot but unneceſſarily repeat; and therefore mean to tell you only what you do not know.</p>
               <p>A little before that news came to the King your father, that thoſe two revolted ſlaves, the perfidious <hi>Rozalcan</hi> and his brother, not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have made themſelves Kings, and abſolute Lords of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Decan,</hi> grown proud in their ſucceſſes, would yet more advance their Victories, even to aſſault the King your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, power, from whom they newly had uſurp'd, and moſt unjuſtly taken the Country of <hi>Canara,</hi> with thoſe three goodly Cities, <hi>Onor, Mangalor,</hi> and <hi>Baticalus,</hi> which bordered on their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and lay convenient for them; a little I ſay, before this ill news arriv'd at Court, we were in a maze to ſee comming towards us, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> whom we were forc'd to leave by reaſon
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56329:72"/>of his wound, in the beſieged City, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us, that the Princeſſe <hi>Orixa,</hi> whom we mourned for, was well alive, and more than ever, beautiful.</p>
               <p>I will not dwell in telling you, after what faſhion ſorrowfull <hi>Piroxenus</hi> did receive this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py news, which at a ſuddain overcomming him, thought by exceſſe of that unhop'd for joy to work the ſame effects upon his heart, that ſorrow did; and truly Madam, I apprehended it my ſelf with ſuch contentment, for his ſake, that I was like to fall into a Feavor by the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motion of my ſpirits. But becauſe we both made ſhew, to doubt the truth of what he told us ſo contentfull, though related by a ſervant of as perfect credit, as fidelity; <hi>Neander</hi> for our better ſatisfaction made us a diſcourſe (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thus,) of all had paſt at <hi>Viſaporus</hi> ſince we left it.</p>
               <p>Know Sirs, ſaid he, that as ſoon as they had carryed me into the beſieged City, and that I had cauſed the bodies of the two Princes <hi>Araxus,</hi> and <hi>Demonax,</hi> to be carried with me to have them buried (according to the order you gave) in their fathers burying place; Deſiring to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit my ſelf of ſuch other commands as ye had given me, as ſoon as I was laid in my bed, and that my wound was dreſt, I ſent to entreat the wiſe <hi>Evander,</hi> and the Princeſſe Nurſe, to come unto me, to declare them your intentions, which I in perſon could not execute.</p>
               <p>Although the old man were exceedingly pleas'd to underſtand of your ſafe eſcape out of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56329:73"/>the danger of that ſally, which ye undertook, yet was he extremely afflicted that he was enfore'd to lead his life ſo far off from ye. As for the Nurſe, I cannot chuſe but wonder that ſhe had not died a thouſand times of grief, ſince firſt ſhe thought her dear, and beautious Miſtreſſe loſt: but when ſhe went into her Chamber to perform towards her, her laſt offices, with grave <hi>Evandes</hi> only in her company, ſhe fell to admiration, that when claſping her within her arms, and with her tears bedewing all her face, ſhe found a kinde of reſpiration, and that ſhe mixt a ſigh with hert. Immediately ſhe clap'd her hand upon her heart, where ſhe perceiv'd the warmth was all retir'd, and holding of her arm, ſhe felt her pulſe began again to beat. <hi>Evander,</hi> cry'd ſhe out, in great amazement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56329:74"/>I will not repeat you the complaints ſhe made; unfeignedly, they were extreme, and if any thing oblig'd her to out-live her Parents, and without deſperation to endure their loſſe, it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort only they had given her, in aſſurance, that her Husband liv'd in his eſcape; who taking it for granted ſhe was dead, as all we did, he had reſolv'd to follow her, but that his friend had hindred him, and by conſtraint enforced him to live for love of him; though, in ſuch caſe, as by affliction he was caſt into, death had been ſweeter to him far than life; and that no longer able to endure that City, which had heap'd ſo many miſeries upon him, he undertook that ſally which ſucceeded to them, and had been ſo fatal to the brother Princes, who could not with more glory have expir'd. At length, Madam, ſaid <hi>Evander</hi> to her, where ever <hi>Piroxenus</hi> be, I can aſſure you he is living, if a continual tract of torments may be called life, and even as ſoon as <hi>Neanders</hi> would is whole, he ſhall go tell him how you do, and well I know, thoſe Princes will uſe all their power to ſettle you again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your fathers, Throne. Meanwhile, I pray, have patience, Madam, and take comfort from the gods: but becauſe all the world thinks you are dead, and that the noiſe thereof is ſpread into the enemies Camp; I think tis beſt to let it run ſo ſtill, and even that all the inhabitants of <hi>Viſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porus</hi> may believe it likewiſe, that when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall become Maſters of the City, which in a day or two will be, when I have capitulated with them, they may not ſatisfie their cruelty on
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56329:74"/>you, who would undoubtedly aſwage their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Meanwhilke you ſhould conceal your ſelf, and taking on you another name, and parentage, ſhould paſſe as a kinſwoman to your Nurſe, who ſhall take you into her houſe which ſhe hath in the City, where we deſire we may to morrow, conveigh you ſecretly,</p>
               <p>The Princeſs who expected aid and Comfort no where elſe except from us, did all ſhe could to pacifie her ſorrow in obedience to the Counſel we had given her, and, when ſhe was in place of ſafety, <hi>Evander</hi> call'd the chiefeſt of the City to my Lodging, who being battered with their loſſes and misfortunes, were of our opinion, that it was expedient, they ſhould ſend to tell the two uſurpers, that the Magiſtrates were ready to give up themſelves unto them, as their Lords, and Matters, on condition they ſhould uſe them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably.</p>

               <p>He took his leave of me with tears in his eyes, and gaveme a great charge of you at parting: Haſte thee <hi>Neander,</hi> ſaid he, to be well, and go finde out our Maſters, with as much good ſpeed as may be, and tell them from me, they no longer pleaſe themſelves to go unknown; for I foreſee more miſeries do threaten them, under the names of <hi>Ariomant</hi> and <hi>Caliſtenus,</hi> and bid them not forget the hazards they have run, whiles they were known as <hi>Taxilus</hi> and <hi>Cleontus.</hi> As for me, ſaid the good old man, as ſoon as I have receiv'd the Princeſſe commands, I purpoſe to make all the haſte my age will give me leave, to carry news of them unto their parents, if ſo the gods allow me ſtrength enough to do my journey.</p>

And therefore, Madam, we freely told him who wee were, together as I have done you, the firſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our journey, and all that hapned ſince our leaving <hi>Gouzarate,</hi> unto the entertainment of my love which I had made you. We told him more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that the fair <hi>Orixa</hi> was ſtill living, and how we had underſtood it.

Alas, Madam, unwittingly he by thoſe words did propheſie his own misfortune; for as you know he periſh'd in that glorious deſign, which with his life he did accompliſh.</p>
               <p>He had in ſhort ſpace, put all thoſe Cities of <hi>Decan,</hi> which were neer to <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> under the King your Fathers ſubjection; and having known that the enemy kept the field, and that they dar'd not to immure themſelves, he reſolv'd to give them Battell, where we obſerved ſuch acts of his, as are not equalled by any Hiſtory: among other exploits worthy of memory, he killed <hi>Zabain</hi> with his own hand, and had from <hi>Rozalcan,</hi> his mortall wound, which quickly after we reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; for when I ſaw him hurt, who never parted one ſtep from him, I ruſh'd with fury on the guard about our enemy, and ſeconded by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed courage of <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> I found no Arms defenceable againſtmy hewing blade; I in one inſtant overthrew that rabble rout, and took their leader Priſoner: in ſhort, we won the Battell,

               <p>I muſt make an end, Madam, continued the Prince <hi>Anaxander,</hi> though not without renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both as well my own, as your diſpleaſures: The poor <hi>Aronthus</hi> ſeeing we deſpaired of his life, did all he could to make us willing of his death; and his great courage prompted him to utter, though in dying, a number of exceeding brave things, which by his people were taken for as many marks of his admired generoſity; He charg'd them all to give obedience to <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> and my ſelf, to finiſh what had been ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and that without declaring to them who we were, becauſe we had entreated him he

               <p>When he at large had uttered his full intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he worthily rewarded all his ſervants, and gave fair gifts to thoſe who had well ſerv'd him in that war; and having with all fervency, and zeal, commended his ſoul unto the Gods, not willing to truſt his Secretary, he called one of his Squires, even him, who two dayes ſince, I followed, where I had the honour of acceſs unto you, Madam, and bid him get him Pen, and Ink, for that hee found himſelf yet ſtrong enough to leave his laſt Will for his dear Siſter under his own hand: before he had made an end of it, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his heart to fail him, he charged <hi>Saradyn</hi> his Squire, who is now yours, to ſeal it with his Seal, and give it to no hand but yours; death came ſo faſt upon him, as he was conſtrain'd to leave it imperfect, but he had ſo much reaſon, as to ſee it Sealed in his preſence ere he died, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Madam, by that I have collected from your words ſince my return, his care did only tend to give you knowledge of our births, and that to mitigate your ſorrow for his death, he would be firſt, ſhould tell you of his quality, whoſe heart was vowed to you, and whoſe ſervices you had not ſcorn'd. Then <hi>Orazia</hi> drew the Letter from her Pocket, whereupon they wept again; and after <hi>Anaxander</hi> had wip'd off his tears, he thus went on to end his Story.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:56329:78"/>
               <p>Madam, ſaid he, as ſoon as brave <hi>Aronthus</hi> ſoul had taken flight among the Gods, we caus'd his body to be pretiouſly embalm'd, which though ſo inanimate, wee accounted worthy of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, if ſo the King thought good to grant that honour to his memory, which could not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently perform'd towards ſo great a Prince; we therefore ſent a Poſt unto the King your Father, to advertiſe him, of what misfortune had befaln his only Son, and that with common conſent all the Army meant as ſoon as <hi>Viſaporus</hi> ſhould bee taken, to conduct the Corps to <hi>Baticalus,</hi> where we had underſtood the King, with all his Court, was gone, ſince <hi>Liſimantus</hi> by his valour had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd it from the enemy, and that we meant, if he ſo pleaſed, to accompany the pomp of his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, with that of his Triumph, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of.</p>
               <p>Some few dayes after, <hi>Saradin</hi> departed with the dead Princes Letter; and we, Madam, drew right to <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> which was not three Leagues diſtant from us: but firſt we ſummon'd them to yeeld themſelves, as we did alſo, unto thoſe of <hi>Goa, Ballagate, Chaul, Bider,</hi> and <hi>Danaget,</hi> which were the Capitall Cities of <hi>Decan,</hi> and which we would reduce under obedience to <hi>Orixa,</hi> there was not one that made ſo much as ſhew of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out againſt us; but having loſt their lawfull Lords, and of themſelves not able to maintain themſelves, they voluntarily ſubmitted to the King your Father, whoſe Authority they hop'd was much more pleaſing, and more honourable, than the rule of two revolved ſlaves, which only
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56329:79"/>force, had made them ſubject to.</p>
               <p>Madam, I fear to hold you over long, if I ſhould punctually relate you all that hapned us in <hi>Viſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porus,</hi> where ſoon the Gates were opened to us, and, if I ſhould tell you all the joy, and pleaſures <hi>Piroxenus</hi> felt, when he ſaw, his dear and ſaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>Orixa</hi> in a private houſe, where ſhe, unknown to any other ſave her Nurſe, had liv'd under the name of <hi>Aſteria:</hi> know only, Madam, that there never was ſo great equality of tranſports, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall embracements, as they two exchang'd, where I forbare not too, to take my part, as by the duty of my friendſhip I was bound, without impediment to theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piroxenus</hi> began preſently to talk of re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing his Spouſe, without expecting the King your fathers approbation, with whoſe Forces on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we had compaſs'd our deſignes; but ſeeing that the heat of his paſſion moved him ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I reſtrain'd him; and far was that adviſed Princeſs, to whom we had already told all our adventures, and pretenſions, from preſſing us thereto: ſhe would not give conſent to be ſo much as known alive, till we were known unto the King. I mean, ſaid ſhe, to paſſe ſtill for <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> whiles my faithful husband goes for <hi>Caliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and that <hi>Anaxander</hi> wears the name of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omant:</hi> the gods forbid, that ever I delight to reign alone, or that I reckon the Decanians my Subjects till <hi>Piroxenus</hi> do receive the Oath of their Alegiance. Go then, ſaid ſhe, preſent your ſelves unto the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> like Princes as your are, and you, my faithfull husband, do
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56329:79"/>your beſt, that ſolemnly our Marriage may again be ſhortly witneſſed, when <hi>Anaxanders,</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razias</hi> Weddings are ſolemnized.</p>
               <p>We did as ſhe commanded, Madam, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her in a mean quality as ſhe deſir'd, when we had left as Governor an old ſervant of <hi>Aron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> we took our leaves of her, and went to fetch the body where we left it, which in the pomp you ſaw, we followed to this City.</p>
               <p>There <hi>Anaxander</hi> finiſhed his Hiſtory, and his dear <hi>Orazia</hi> who for <hi>Orixas</hi> ſatisfaction, as her own, died almoſt, in her longing deſire that they ſhould ſhew themſelves unto the King for ſuch as really they were, pray'd them to be there again next evening, to reſolve, how to contrive a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great importance: Meanwhile, without more ſtay, our faithfull Lovers interchang'd their Marriage faith, which they confirm'd with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall kiſſes in the preſence both of <hi>Piroxenus</hi> and of <hi>Lifimena</hi> too. And being late, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to part untill next night, although their hearts and inds were not at all divided.</p>

I have already ſaid, he was a ſpie for <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> who had gained him by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and gifts, and having ſeen through certain rails, the two Princes enter at a ſecret door into the Arbor, without underſtanding either their

               <p>The Cavallier was yet in bed, where, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, his amorous thoughts had not allowd him any reſt, when that unfaithful Meſſenger came to diſturb his mind, more cruelly by that unhappy news, than it had ever been. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, as tis the common cuſtom of men in love, to think that only their Miſtreſſes are look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo great a power hath jealouſie over the higheſt ſpirits, he made himſelf believe that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omant</hi> (for he knew not <hi>Anaxander</hi> but under that borrowed name) was lov'd of <hi>Liſimena;</hi> and ſince that a great courage endureth nothing more impatiently than ſcorn, ſeeing another was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his prejudice in private, and imagining, that that was the ſole obſtaele that hindred him from being lov'd of <hi>Liſimena,</hi> he reſolves him inſtantly to take revenge of both, and to comprize as well <hi>Orazia</hi> as an acceſſary unto that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which they us'd towards him in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon loſſe.</p>
               <p>But his generouſneſs not ſuffering his choler in ſuch ſort to blinde him, or to be led unto ſo baſe a revenge, after a tedious conſultation with himſelf, at length, his anger wholly bent to <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and although himſelf had but three daies before, aſſiſted to renew that bloody edict againſt Duels, not able reſolve to expell his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary enemy, but by honorable waies, without more ado, becauſe his jealous fury would admit
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56329:81"/>of no delay, he purpoſed to watch him, from that very evening when he ſhould return unto his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous appointment, that he might aſſign an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and provoke him to ſight with him. He had underſtood from <hi>Aquilant</hi> by what way he had accuſtomed to enter the Garden of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and becauſe he had alſo learnt that he came alwaies accompanied with his friend, without farther enquiry, and diſſembling what he thought, before <hi>Aquilant,</hi> he went to one <hi>Zenobus,</hi> whom he had made Governor of <hi>Baticalus,</hi> and of whoſe courage he had great aſſurance, having ſeen in ſeverall occaſions his performance, and drawing him aſide, diſcours'd thus to him.</p>
               <p>Brave <hi>Zenobus,</hi> thou knoweſt the love I bear thee, and after what manner I have ever truſted my important ſecrets to thy judgement, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: wherefore, I intend no longer preamble to tell thee that I need thy ſword to aid me, in the demanding of reaſon for an affront I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; It troubles me to take thee from that place ſo ſoon, ſo proper for thee, and which thou oughteſt longer to enjoy, becauſe, undoubtedly the rigor of the late Edict, will force thy ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; But I would ſwear, (ſo well am I aſſored of thy bravery,) that better fortunes could not hinder thee from running hazards with me.</p>
               <p>A man that had not been very generous, would have been much amaz'd at this diſcourſe, for one of theſe he muſt reſolve, either to quit the Land, or elſe expoſe himſelf to an exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to appeaſe the Kings anger: But <hi>Zenobus,</hi> whoſe hears was good, and who beſides his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56329:82"/>to <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> found himſelf engagd to ſerve him for his honor ſake, anſwer'd him freely, that he held it for great honor, that he would elect him for that occaſion; how that it was one of the greateſt proofs he ever had receiv'd of his eſteem, and friendſhip, and that he ſhould not ſo much as mention the Government of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalus,</hi> for that he never did account thereof, but as he had received it of him, and that he ſhould gain more by following him than by a conſtant reſidence in one place, where he, after could not be eye-witneſſe of his fair exploits. <hi>Liſimantus</hi> very much pleaſed at that freedom, nam'd him the man, with whom he was to do, and having a neer gueſs at <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and <hi>Piroxenus</hi> his ſwords, they fitted two of equall length. But <hi>Zenobus</hi> who was not ſo blinded with paſſion as <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> whiles the hour that ſhould be favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his friends revenge approached, had the care to make proviſion for his ſurety, and his own: and foraſmuch as they had purpoſed to fight by the light of the Moon, upon the Sea ſhore, he cauſed a Bark to be ready to tranſport them into <hi>Zeylan,</hi> a ſure ſanctuary for them, when they ſhould have ſlain their enemies, over whom they hoped for a ſuddain victory. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimantus</hi> approv'd of that deſign, becauſe, if after that Duel, he ſhould fall into the King of <hi>Narſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> his hands, a moſt ſevere obſerver, and beyond imagination, of his Edicts, he muſt run a great hazard (although a ſtranger as he was,) to ſerve, as an example, and his ſervices done the Crown might not (it may be) have aſſured him. The
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56329:82"/>heat of the day was over, and night by its ſweet humidity, began to invite all the world to reſt, except our Lovers, whom for ſeverall reſpects it doubly diſquieted: For <hi>Anaxander</hi> who on the one ſide came accompanied with his friend, to bid fare well unto his Princeſs, ſeared to be too late at his amorous randezvous, and on the other ſide <hi>Liſimantus</hi> feared his too late arrival; whoſe impatience ſcarce permitted any longer to defer his taking revenge.</p>
               <p>He kept himſelf concealed in a by corner of the ſtreet, every minute complaining to his faith-full <hi>Zenobus,</hi> that his adverſary was too long a comming, when he ſpied him appear with his dear <hi>Piroxenus</hi> walking a little before, going as twere the round, ſurveighing every quarter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, to ſee if he could diſcover any body. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimantus,</hi> and his ſecond, inſtantly retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to give them leave to come neerer the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes Garden door, which ſtood betwixt ſhut, and open, to receive them: And when they were neer enough, ſtay <hi>Ariomant,</hi> cry'd <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> who therewithall ſtept forth, ſtay thou perſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, thou haſt too long enjoy'd a happineſſe which I have better than thy ſelf deſerved, and is refuſed me, by ungratefull Fortune; I have prepar'd thee other Cates, than thoſe thou goeſt to, in the Garden: let us but draw aſide a little, that we may not be interrupted, and I ſhall tell thee my reſentments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anaxander</hi> who diſtruſted nothing, was much aſtoniſhed to ſee himſelf diſcovered; and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that treaſon had been contrived for him, by
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56329:83"/>ſome one of the Princeſſes domeſtiques, but when by the brightneſſe of the Moon, which was by this time well advanced he diſcovered <hi>Liſiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> he was more than formerly, ſurpriz'd; for he knew he was in love with <hi>Liſimena,</hi> and thought his jealouſie deceived him, however, finding himſelf offended at the injurious words, which inconſiderately he ſpake, that he had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter merit than himſelf, inſtead of more courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſaluting him, which undoubtedly he had done, if he had come with mildneſſe to him: <hi>Liſimantus</hi> ſaid he to him, had not thy choler too much at firſt tranſported thee, I would have plaint<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſhewn thee thy miſtake: but ſeeing thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption renders thee unworthy of excuſe, I mean to ſhew the preſently, that in ill time thou haſt delighted to offend a man, of greater juſtice than thy ſelf. Lets talk no more, reply'd <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus,</hi> and that as ſew may ſee us as we can, lets fight upon the ſtrand which is not above two hundred paces hence, thou haſt no reaſon to defer it till another time, becauſe the Moon is bright, and I have brought a man to entertain your friend. Lets go ſaid <hi>Anaxander,</hi> I am not ſo good at words, as actions.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile that this was doing, the Princeſſes who heard confuſedly the murmure of their voices, though ignorant of the cauſe, for fear of ſcandal, ſhut the door which was but little open: and when they found, that <hi>Anaxander</hi> came not, they imagined a part of the misfortune which had hapned, and thought that ſome one had watched the two Princes, and pricked onward
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56329:83"/>with ſome juſt ſenſe, had ſought for reaſon, and that undoubtedly, that was the cauſe from which the noiſe they heard, proceeded.</p>
               <p>Immediately the fair <hi>Orazia</hi> caus'd <hi>Saradin</hi> to be call'd to her, and with her eyes, laden with tears, conjured him to run to <hi>Anaxanders</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that if there he found him not, he ſhould ſeek every where, and try if he could diſcover no body on the ſtrand, becauſe ſhe was aſſiu'd ſhe heard ſome quarel at the Garden door. <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> made all the haſte he could to finde our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants, but he had too late notice of it; for the buſineſſe was diſpatched ere he found them, whoſe deplorable concluſion, fill'd him with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and confuſion; and had much more wrought upon his heart, if he had known but <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimantus</hi> his ſtory. But becauſe there was never ſeen, ſo furious a Combate ſought, as between thoſe four, it will not be impertinent, to give you the deſcription in a few words.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they were come, where <hi>Liſimantus</hi> had a mind to lead them on the ſtrand, having caſt off their Dublets, &amp; unſheath'd their ſwords, and that their ſeconds had ſeperated themſelves about an hundred paces from them, that they might not hinder them, they witneſs'd all bus one reſentment, and who had ſeen them could not have diſcern'd the ſeconds from the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals, ſo eqaully were they incenſed to revenge.</p>

                  <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> began firſt, whiles their friends were going off, and made an infinite number of thruſts in the beginning, to ſee if they could dazle one the other, or ſet each other out

               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Piroxenus</hi> having to do with a valiant enemy, had a hard task to overcome him; at firſt they made five or ſix thruſts at one another, without hurt, and <hi>Zouobus</hi> truſting in his exceeding force, the ſecond paſſe let fall his ſword, to cloſe, and graſp <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> whom he conſtrain'd to quit his likewiſe, that he might the better ſtruggle with him: They long diſputed after this manner, at length they came to ground, and <hi>Piroxenus</hi> no leſſe ſtrong than dexterous, had the good hap to fall upon his enemy, whom he might have ſtrangled if he would, for that the fall was very ſoul. <hi>Zenobus</hi> finding himſelf in ſo ill
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56329:84"/>caſe; Sir Knight, cryed he out, if we end not our Combate after another manner than this, it will not be in haſte that we ſhall help our friends; it was not I that began ſaid <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> thou wouldſt fain prevail by thy might, and the gods have ordered that thy ſubtilty hath ſerved to thy prejudice: However, though thou art already o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, to let thee know I can tell how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer every way, I give thee leave to take thy ſword again, to defend thy ſelf againſt mine, which is able to lay thee once more levill with the ground: and therewithall he roſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned toward <hi>Zenobus</hi> with his ſword in his hand, who being much broken by the greatneſs of his fall, fought not again with ſo much nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe as formerly, although his courage were continually the ſame, he was therefore fain to recoil at thoſe gallant onſets <hi>Piroxenues</hi> gave him at the firſt, and in retiring had the ill fortune to light upon a ſtone, over which he fell backward, when inſtantly <hi>Piroxenus</hi> lept upon him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made him yield his ſword, he ran withall his might to ſuccour <hi>Anaxander,</hi> whom he found fallen on one ſide, not able any longer to help himſelf, for the loſſe of blood which ran every where, out of his wounds, and <hi>Liſimantus</hi> on the other in the ſame condition.</p>
               <p>They both yet breathed, when <hi>Piroxenus</hi> came neer them, but with very little ſign of life. By and by, without ſtaying to bemoan his friend, who had more need of ready help, than uſeleſſe tears, he drew out of his pocket a precious Balme, with which he preſently anointed all his wounds and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56329:85"/>toar his ſhirt in divers places to bin them up a well as he could. But as ſoon as he gave them air, he perceived him by little and little to vaniſh in his arms, turning ſweetly his eyes towards him, without being able to ſpeak one word.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Piroxenus</hi> believing that his friend was dead, who was but in a ſwound, felt in his own heart deadly touches; and moreover fearing leſt ſome Officer of juſtice might ſurpriz: the body in that unhappy ſtate, and exerciſe the rigor of the new Edict on him, as an example, was in a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtraight, and a thouſand times tempted to deſpair, and open with his own hand a way through which he might follow his dear <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zenobus</hi> having on another ſide, found his friend weak, and at the point of death, ran haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the bark which he had cauſed to be ready neer the ſhore, not far from the Haven, and brought the Chirurgion which he had provided there, with the three Saylers, and having found that <hi>Liſimantus</hi> had yet ſome ſmall motion of his pulſe, they carried him upon a Coverlet into the Veſſel, that they might preſerve at leaſt his body, and immediately hoyſt ſail, to leave the Coaſts of <hi>Zeylan.</hi> Scarce were they unmoared, when <hi>Saradin</hi> arriv'd, with <hi>Almerin,</hi> and <hi>Nean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the faithful ſervants of our two Princes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for ſatisfaction of what the Princeſſe had told him, he had run firſt to <hi>Anaxanders</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and not finding him there, knowing how great conſidence his Couſin and himſelf had of <hi>Almerin,</hi> and <hi>Neander,</hi> had lead them with him,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56329:85"/>that he might not fail of what he went about, which had been hard for him to do alone. But O ye gods, how ſad and woful ſpectacle at once beheld they: At firſt they found one of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſtretched out in his blood upon the ſands, having nor heat nor motion, and then the other deſperate, weeping, and curſing heaven, that had preſerv'd his life: none of them knew in that extremity what to reſolve; for if on the one ſide, they lamented for <hi>Anaxanders</hi> death, they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the other left two or three fiſhermen who had ſeen the Combate might reveal it, and not daring to carry back the body into the Town, they neither of them knew what place of ſurety to diſpoſe it in. In this confuſion <hi>Saradin</hi> was diſpatched, in behalf of them all, toward the Princeſſe, to advertiſe her of this accident, that ſhe on her ſide might try to remedy it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that he whom ſhe had choſen for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band might not again be unfortunate after his death.</p>
               <p>The poor <hi>Orazia</hi> in the deadly apprehenſion of that diſafter, which ſhe had foreſeen, had cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all her women to retire, and ſhut her ſelf into her Chamber to entertain her melancholy alone; when <hi>Saradin,</hi> in truth a little too inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ſearful manner brought her the woful news of her Lovers death.</p>
               <p>The word wounded her heart, as ſoon as her ear, and as a ſharp dart, peirced it on every ſide; ſhe ſtrove to reſiſt the unhappineſs which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized her; but ſhe was taken at an inſtant, in ſo much, as ſtaggering in <hi>Saradins</hi> arms who held
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56329:86"/>her up, he was at length conſtrain'd to let her fall upon the Velvet floar clean loſt; he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to call her women to her aid, but, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the accident requir'd but ſew witneſſes, and finding in her Cloſet, ſome cold water, he caſt thereof upon her face, and cauſed her eyes to half open: Madam, cryed he ſuddenly to her, come to your ſelf, deſpair not before time, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily <hi>Anaxander</hi> may not be dead: and that which makes me think he is not, is becauſe you were your ſelf even now, juſt in his plight, and I perceive you breath again; then preſently he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced her bodies, and when ſhe had more liberty, ſhe opened broad her eyes, which ſuddainly were drowned in a multitude of tears: and when ſhe would have unclos'd her mouth, to have ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the with her complaints, and griefs, ſhe could not uster more than two or three ſight, which ſhe drow from the bottom of her heart, and were as many witneſſes of her moſt deadly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. <hi>Saradin</hi> conceived by that action that ſhe was not yet perfectly come to her ſelf, and though her fair eyes were exceedingly troubled, he ſaw as clearly as in her heart, the ſecond ſeebleneſs that threatned her, and caſt water again upon her face and wrung her hands, and cryed in her car, and us'd ſuch means, as that at length, he got her perfectly out of her ſwoundings.</p>
               <p>When ſhe was ready to begin her complaints, one of her women took the boldneſſe to enter her Chamber, to give notice, that a Gentleman deſiring to ſpeak with <hi>Saradin,</hi> about matters of great importance, expected him at the door. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:56329:86"/>imagining it to be one of thoſe whom he had left with <hi>Anaxander</hi> went forth with leave of the Princeſſe, and found it to be <hi>Almerin,</hi> who was come haſtily to tell them that his Maſtet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved yet, and that ſome order or other muſt be ſpeedily taken to perſerve him, for that there ran already through the City a whiſper of that Duel; <hi>Saradin</hi> intreated his patience a little, and ran into the Cloſet, to repair the evill, which his firſt intelligence had cauſed; The Princeſſe, commanded that <hi>Almerin</hi> ſhould he let enter, who recounted to her his Maſters adventure, whom they had lamented dead, how God be praiſed he was come again to himſelf, how they had brought him out of the way, and upon their cloaks carried him unto a green bed, where he was much better than upon the ſtrand: but where the moiſtneſſe of the night might however do him great harm, in caſe he were not ſuddainly ſuccoured. Hereof they all three conſulted, and <hi>Saradin</hi> having propoſed to have him conveighed unto a Caſtle which he had ſome ten leagues off, upon the road to <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> the Princeſs held it fit, without conſidering, in the trouble ſhe was in, as well as the reſt, that that Caſtle, was the firſt lodging the King meant to take, who within two daies intended to depart from <hi>Bacicalus</hi> to return for <hi>Biſnagar;</hi> and having made choice of a very excellent Chirurgion, and the Princeſs furniſhe the Litter, they went to take <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and together with <hi>Piroxonus,</hi> and <hi>Neander,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaighed him all the night as far as the Caſtle, where <hi>Saradin</hi> at firſt conceal'd him in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56329:87"/>very private, for fear the King in paſſing might diſcover him.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he had ſitted him with what was neceſſary, he left him in the company of his dear <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> and his two Gentlemen, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the gallop, to <hi>Baticalus,</hi> which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready full of that Duel. And to prevent a ſearch, the Princeſſe thought good to ſpread a noiſe, that <hi>Anaxander</hi> was ſlain, for that <hi>Liſimantus</hi> was ſeen fly, and that the fiſhermen who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it, had ſeen <hi>Anaxander</hi> ſtretched out in his own blood, without any appearance of life, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented of his people, and be wailed of his friends, which gave an eaſie credit of his death. It was the abſence only of thoſe valiant Cavalliers, and of their friends, which gave ſuſpicion they had fought: for not withſtanding the noiſe of their Duel, which had run through the City, had they returned ſafe, there being no man to accuſe them, they had run no hazard, nor fallen into any kinds of trouble.</p>
               <p>But, when the King found them all four away, and that he knew, that thoſe from whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected greateſt ſupports, in the maintainance of his Edict, had been the firſt infringers: he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and ſwearing deeply, that he would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged even upon the dead, commanded, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riomants</hi> body ſhould be ſought for, to expoſe it, to the ſhame of puniſhment. I perceive ſaid he, my authority is very openly ſcorned, and I were very worthy to be laughed at by my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, if I endured the violation of an Edict, made but three daies ſince, for whoſe execution
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56329:87"/>I have ſo ſolemnly ſworn upon the Altars. I vow again, even by my Fathers Soul, that <hi>Liſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus,</hi> though a ſtranger as he is, ſhall repent him of it, and, that he ſhall not ſo cloſe keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>Zeylan,</hi> but I will one day ſinde him our to be revenged on him: As for <hi>Ariomant,</hi> who hath been as it were naturaliz'd among us, and who hath lived under my pay, I will, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure our juſtice, and that his body, dead as it is, be diſmembred by the miniſters of juſtice; and I proclaim him, an enemy to my State, and Crown, whoever ſhall conceal, or aſſiſt to the cloſe keeping of <hi>Galiſtenus:</hi> in continuance of this proteſtation, he promiſed the Government (which <hi>Zenobus</hi> had) of <hi>Baticalus,</hi> to whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould bring him any one of thoſe four, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alive, or dead; immediately every man ſets himſelf upon the queſt: but there was too faith-full a care had of <hi>Anaxanders</hi> ſurety, whoſe wounds however great, being found not deadly, <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> and he, made but ſport of that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; they promiſed themſelves, to ſpend the time merrily one day with the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> when they ſhould return to <hi>Gonzarat</hi> in Princes equipage, having ſent their Embaſſadors before them.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, for fear leſt the noiſe of that Duel, and the pretended death of <hi>Anaxan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> ſpread through all parts, might not cauſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rixa,</hi> whom they had left unknown in <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> to ſuſpect ſome diſaſter, they diſpatched <hi>Nean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> toward her, for her ſatisfaction, and to tell her, the cauſe of their delay, aſſuring her, that as
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56329:88"/>ſoon as <hi>Anaxander</hi> ſhould be recovered, they would travel for <hi>Gouzarat,</hi> and return with all expedition, in the quality they had promiſed her, taking with them only faithful <hi>Almerin,</hi> to ſerve them, as occaſion offered it ſelf.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the King cauſing ſo exact a ſearch to be made for <hi>Ariomant,</hi> ſent every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Oyazias</hi> ſoul, moſt deadly fears, who doubting that her <hi>Ariomant</hi> was not enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, was a thouſand times tempted to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his name, and birth unto her Father, for at voiding ſuch inconveniencies as might happen: ſhe was thereto more preſſed, by the perſwaſions of <hi>Liſimena,</hi> who ſeeing the Kings rage each hour increaſe, for want of news, was of opinion, that by telling him the true extraction of thoſe two Princes, (it was beſt to hold him no longer in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) who were not Subject to his juriſdiction, nor the obſervation of his Laws: But whatever great appearances obliged her to this diſcovery, <hi>Orazia</hi> feared to be worſe than that word ſhe had given the two Princes, not to make them known, untill they were returned to <hi>Gouzarat,</hi> and therefore ſhe entreated <hi>Liſimena</hi> to continue the ſecret, and not reveal it till the time were come.</p>
               <p>So our two Heroes remain'd conceal'd in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radins</hi> Caſtle, untill <hi>Anaxander</hi> were recovered, and being both aſſured of their miſtreſſe ſavours, burnt with one equal impatience of returning to their own Provinces, where they expected ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, that the good <hi>Evander</hi> (who ſhould have been long ſince returned) ſhould have regained
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56329:88"/>for them, <hi>Alcidaris</hi> good will; but this ſage old man was taken, and held ſick, ſome ſix, or ſeven daies journey from <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> which hindred the performance of his commiſſion, ſo ſoon as he ought, and that he could not come time enough, to divert an Embaſſage, which tended to the ruin of <hi>Anezanders</hi> contentment, as you ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by what does follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcidaris</hi> the great, had by the common noiſe, learnt all that had befaln his ſon <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and his nephew <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> which gave him wonderful diſcontentments: And becauſe in that great ſally, they had made, where the two Princes, <hi>Araxus,</hi> and <hi>Demonax</hi> were ſlain upon the place, ſome of thoſe, who ſled from the confuſion (as well as they themſelves) had ſpread the news of their deaths, as in truth, ſew men knew what was become of them; the King of <hi>Cambaya</hi> believing them out of the world, notwithſtanding all their youthful parts, and follies paſt, was hardly able to be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: eſpecially, when he reflected on their amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſence, and the good education which they had gotten in his houſe, and that which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his affliction, was to ſee, that that child, which remained to him by his former wife, was ſo unhappy born, as not be acceptable to one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he had; the moſt complacent, and fouleſt flatteners of his Court, wanted boldneſſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud his ridiculous actions, or commend him, be never did any thing but out of ſeaſon, if he had a mind to oblige, he did the contrary, and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was as natural, as vice unto him: however,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56329:89"/>this unhappy father, who believed that he had no other child alive, finding himſelf obliged to marry him, not, for any good inclinations he had for him, but for the proper intereſt of his greatneſſe, and to perperuate his name, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, having known of the death of <hi>Arontus</hi> ſole ſon unto the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> who had remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but one only daughter, heir to all his Eſtates, thought good, together with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, to ſeek her in Marriage for his ſon: for this purpoſe he diſpatched <hi>Pirobus</hi> (who had wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily ſerved him in divers other occaſions) in an Embaſſage towards the King of <hi>Narſing a,</hi> as well to condole with him, the loſſe of his ſon, as to deſire his daughter; of which, the young <hi>Alcida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> had no ſooner underſtood, but he burſt out a weeping as if he had loſt all his friends. For he had fallen in love with a mean towns-mans daughter, whom by all means he would marry, and for her ſake deſpiſed the love of the greateſt Ladies, and the rareſt beauties of the Court. This faithful <hi>Pirobus,</hi> whoſe age, and abilities made him very venerable, ſoon after departed from <hi>Campanel,</hi> and having learned on the way, shat the King, to whom he was ſent, remained yet at <hi>Baticalus,</hi> made ſo good journeys, as he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, the very next day after that Duel had been fought.</p>
               <p>The King received him magnificently; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the diſpleaſure he took at that ſo late fought Combate, he reſolved to give him Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, before he would depart for <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> that the grave oid man might have leſſe labour, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56329:89"/>journey to return. He knew not the cvill con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditions of the Prince of <hi>Gouzarat,</hi> nor any thing but of the greatneſs of his race, and his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for that indeed, there was not in all <hi>India</hi> a more mighty Monarch than the King his father; He ſtood not long deliberating, whether or not, he ſhould ſatisfie <hi>Pirobus,</hi> and prefer the alliance offered by him, before all other that might be hereafter. And a ſpeciall motive which ſo much rather made him give him his deſire, was, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance given in the King his Maſters behalf, that be had but that child only hopeful to inherit four Kingdoms: And thus you ſee, how the King of <hi>Narſinga</hi> ſent back <hi>Pirobus,</hi> with great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, and fair preſents, and fully pleaſed every way with his ſo happy imployment.</p>
               <p>Before he departed, he was by the Kings leave to kiſſe the hand of his future Princeſs, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing dearer in the world, than that name of <hi>Cambaye,</hi> to whoſe lovely Prince, ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready vowed her ſelf, receiv'd him with a ſmiling countenance, and deſſembling the knowledge of his evill parts, for whom he ſought her, ſaid to <hi>Pirobus,</hi> that the gods had favored her too much, that had deſign'd her for the moſt perfect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed Prince of <hi>Gouzarat</hi> She was even on the point of opening her ſelf wholly to the grave Embaſſadour; becauſe ſhe knew he was the man that had treated the match for <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> mother, and that ſhe happily might do him an exceeding favour, to declare him his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and to tell him where, with <hi>Piroxenus</hi> he was concealed, for having been one of that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56329:90"/>Combat which he heard ſo much noiſe of in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalus:</hi> but ſhe thought beſt to ſay nothing, for fear of diſobliging <hi>Anaxander,</hi> who would not be known in <hi>Narſing a</hi> but with a Royal train, and worthy of the love he made to <hi>Orazia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, becauſe ſhe had a perfect knowledge of her Lovers ſtory, and becauſe ſhe had learnt it from his own mouth, that after the taking of <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> the good <hi>Evander</hi> his old Governor returned to <hi>Gouzarat,</hi> where he was to declare unto <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> the adventures of his ſon, and nephew, ſhe very much wondred that <hi>Pirobus</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the King her father and her ſelf likewiſe, that the Prince in whoſe behalf he was ſent, was the only ſon of his Maſter; among other queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one which ſhe made him of the Kingdom of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> ſhe askt him what was become of the wiſe <hi>Evander,</hi> of whoſe abilities, ſhe had heard ſo much diſcourſe. Madam anſwered the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, we know not what fortune he hath run ſince he ſtole from our Court to purſue the two Prince, whoſe loſſe we have felt ſo ſenſibly, as we ſhall never come again to our ſelves: and for mine own part, Madam, I ſhould be the unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folleſt man alive, if I did not weep for their loſſe as long as I lived. The Princeſs imagined by this diſoourſe that ſome accident had befallen <hi>Evander</hi> on the way, for that his arrivall muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> have pleaſed them, and rather have obliged the King of <hi>Cambaya</hi> to Aiſpatch <hi>Pirabus</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxanders</hi> behalf, than on the part of young <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidaris,</hi> whoſe unfortunate birth a thouſand times a day he curſed.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:56329:90"/>
               <p>But, continuing her diſcourſe, ſhe asked him what aſſurance there was of the two Princes death which he lamented. Madam anſwered <hi>Pirabus,</hi> the common report hath inſtructed us in that unfortunate adventure, they had in <hi>Viſapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> where they ſo beaſtlike were condemn'd to death: I know of each particular ſaid <hi>Orazia,</hi> but certainly they died not there. Tis true, Madam, replyed <hi>Pirobus</hi> that they died not in that conflict; but when <hi>Viſaporus</hi> was beſirged, where the fair <hi>Orixa</hi> died of her Feavor a little after the King of <hi>Decan</hi> her father was murthered in his flight, by a ſerving-man, and, that that cruell end which was not yet come to her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, had cauſed that of the Queen her mother, who ſunk under the burden of her ſorrow, you have underſtood, how the two Princes, <hi>Araxus,</hi> and <hi>Demonax,</hi> finding themſelves put hardly to it, &amp; fearing the two ſtaves who deſired but their lives, cauſed <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and <hi>Piroxenus</hi> our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlers, to think fit to hazard a ſally upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, it being the only way they could attempt to avoid the funy of <hi>Rozinloan,</hi> and <hi>Zabain,</hi> who would reign without impediment. Now, we are told, Madam, of all thoſe who eſcaped living from that fatal ſally, that our Maſters were there ſlain, together with the two Princes of <hi>Decan;</hi> had it not been ſo, we ſhould undoubtedly have ſince heard of them, but their deaths have been confirmed to us by ſo many, that 'twere too great mincredulicy to doubt thereof.</p>
               <p>The beautiful <hi>Orazia</hi> ſeeing that this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death of <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> wrought
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56329:91"/>ſo real a ſorrow in <hi>Pirobus,</hi> did think it charity to tell him the truth: however, not willing to do any thing without <hi>Anaxanders</hi> conſent, and ſeeing that the King her father had yet three daies to remain in <hi>Baticalus,</hi> where the Embaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour had ſtayed him, ſhe diſpatched <hi>Saradin,</hi> whom ſhe could only truſt, and gave him charge to haſten to her Lover, with this advertiſement, and to come back ere <hi>Pirobus</hi> (who was to do part the day following) ſhould return for <hi>Gouza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi> Meanwhile, when the Embaſſadour taking his leave kiſſed her hand, ſhe could not forbear ſaying to him, that ſhe believed thoſe he ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſon, were alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saradin</hi> immediately mounted on an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Courſer, galloped with all ſpeed to his own home, and finding the two Princes together, for that <hi>Piroxenus</hi> ſince <hi>Anaxanders</hi> hurts, had not ſtirred out of his ſight, he related to them the comming of <hi>Pirobus,</hi> the ſubject of his Embaſſage, and the diſcourſe he entertain'd the Princeſs with, which much aſtoniſh'd them, and made them believe, that poor <hi>Evander</hi> was dead on the way. They deliberated ſufficiently what to do hereupon, and whether it were not beſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves upon that occaſion, ſeeing that if they endured the Prince <hi>Alcidaris</hi> his ſute, it might be feared, that the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute upon that match, might in very few daies haſten the accompliſhment. On the other ſide, <hi>Anaxander</hi> held it no way ſafe to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo ſoon after that Combat, which had ſo much diſpleaſed the King, and did moſt wiſely
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56329:91"/>foreſee, that they might be blamed by an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that being by reaſon of the greatneſſe of their bi ths aſſured from the puniſh neut, they had moſt raſhly broken am Edict, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ought to have preſerved inviolable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Dominions of a King, whom they loved, and to whom they ſought to be allied: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n one knee, and weeping for joy, ſtrove to have kiſſed his hand. But <hi>Piroxenus</hi> raiſing him up, venerable <hi>Pirobus,</hi> ſaid he, my Couſin <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and my ſelf have underſtood the cauſe of your
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56329:92"/>journey by a Gentleman, whom the Princeſs <hi>Orazia</hi> ſent unto us, and becauſe the requeſt you have made the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> is utterly oppoſite to the contentment, of your young Prince, who contrary to the belief you have had, is ſtill alive, I am as well in my own as his behalf, come hither to ſalute you, and to acquaint you, with the reaſons obliging us to remain yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in this Kingdom. And here <hi>Piroxenus</hi> made him an ample rehearſall of all their adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and whatever good or evill had befallen them ſince their ſally out of <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> where ſo many men thought they had both come ſhort.</p>
               <p>The good <hi>Pirobus</hi> felt ſo great aſtoniſhment at this recitall, and ſo great a joy, as with much difficulty could he make him anſwer; at length, having recollected his ſenſes, and the liberty of his tongue. Sir ſaid he, is it poſſible that two great Princes as ye are would for meer paſtime endure ſo many troubles, and croſſes? Ah, how the gods have been favourable to us contrary to all expectation in reſtoring us the true props of our Crown, and diſengaging our ſpirits from the juſt fear we had to yield in ſubjection all our lives unto a vicious Prince. And than he would have told him of the evill nature of <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> but that <hi>Piroxenus</hi> let him know that they had underſtood the whole ſtory. Well than (Sir) ſaid <hi>Pirohus</hi> what pleaſe you that I do, will you have me go back, and change my errant to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxanders</hi> behalf? I think the King his father will never diſavow it, and the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> who hath been a witneſſe of his vallour, will be glad
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56329:92"/>to conclude the match without drawing breath, and ſpecially, when I ſhall let him know, his daughter whom he loves ſo dearly ſhall be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of it. No, father (ſaid <hi>Piroxenus)</hi> ſeeing is hath ſo fallen out, that ſage <hi>Evander,</hi> to whom we declared our intenſions, and whom we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to regain the Kings good graces for us, hath met with ſome misfortune, go you with ſpeed and ſupply his room, and obtain that the acts of our youth may be forgotten; thanks to the gods we have committed nothing worthy to be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed for rude, or evill natures, and I think tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſhall ſeem excuſable it being conſidered, that if we have been faulty, tis but for having too much loved, and when it ſhall be ſeen, that we have not been ſo fooliſh, nor ſo ſtupi'd but by our induſtry, we have obtained each of us a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Gothen <hi>Pirobus,</hi> and the gods favour you, we will ſhortly follow as ſoon as <hi>Anaxander</hi> is recovered of his hurts: in the interim, do not for get to tell the King, and Queen, all that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen us, they will undoubtedly be much pleaſed at it, and eſpecially, when they ſhall know, that my <hi>Orixa</hi> lives, and that her Kingdom, which we have helped to recoven from the two ſlaves, Uſurpers, will be hers without diſpute, when the King of <hi>Narſinga</hi> ſhall, as you do know the ſtrange Hiſtory of her life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pirobus</hi> would fain have ſeen <hi>Anaxander</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his return, but ſeeing that <hi>Piroxenus</hi> thought is not beſt, he went right to the port of <hi>God,</hi> to purſue his way to <hi>Gouzarat,</hi> and there to embark himſelf for ſaving much travel, and with tears in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56329:93"/>his eyes departed from <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> who returned to his Couſin with all ſpeed at <hi>Saradins</hi> Cafile, where we will leave him recovering his hurts, to tell you, what paſſed in the Kingdom of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About eight or ten daies after <hi>Pircbus</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Cumpanel,</hi> (the ordinary aboad of <hi>Alcidaris,</hi>) in his Embaſſage to the King of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinga;</hi> the good <hi>Evander,</hi> who long ſince went from <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> and had been hardly uſed on the way by a great ſickneſſe, from which he had much a do to recover, being at length by the gods permiſſion, reſtored, arrived happily at the Capitall City of <hi>Gouzarat:</hi> had there been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſiderable, but his perſon, which was dear to the whole Kingdom, all the Court had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an exceeding contentment at his comming; but when from him in was known, that the two Princes were living, and that from the time they were ſuppoſed to be dead, they had performed a thouſand; goodly actions, Bonefires were kindled through the City, and there was not one, from the greateſt to the leaſt, who did not witneſs one equall impatience for their return, upon which they already eſtabliſhed all the hope and ſafety which the rudeneſs of young <hi>Alcidaris</hi> had even raviſh'd from them.</p>
               <p>But that publique joy, however great, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of the Kings and Queen <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nazarettes,</hi> who weary of the impertenencies of that Prince, ill affected by every body, which they had ſtill before their eyes, and having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten all their anger, and reſentments cauſed by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56329:93"/>the idle abſence of <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> whom indeed they had believed dead, ſailed not from that inſtant to make vows, and prayers for their preſervation, and return. They cauſed their adventures to be told them a thouſand times over, wherein, they could not enough admire the goodneſs of the gods, which had preſerved them: their greateſt wonder was, that <hi>Orixa</hi> yet lived, and had they heard it from others mouth then <hi>Evander,</hi> who had been witneſſe of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, they might had cauſe to doubt it; for <hi>Alcidaris</hi> had underſtood by report, that her pretended death had been one of the principall cauſes, that had obliged our two young Princes to make that great ſally, wherein it was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they were ſlain: but when they knew by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi> how, contrary to all hope ſhe was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of that deadly ſwound, and that ſhe was alive, and well, in a private quality under the name of <hi>Aſteria,</hi> in the City of <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> which had been yield to the two ſlaves, and in which capitulation, he had aſſiſted, they wondered more than ever; for they had known all that had paſt ſince that Siege (during <hi>Evanders</hi> ſickneſs in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can;</hi> they had learnt how <hi>Rozalcan,</hi> and <hi>Zaha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> having in purſuit of their tyrannical victory, uſurped the Province of <hi>Canara</hi> from the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> had been caſtiſed by the Prince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontus:</hi> in ſhort, they were not ignorant that that Prince aided by two valliant Perſian Cavalliers, whom they had heard named <hi>Ariomant,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtenus,</hi> had regained whatſoever was unjuſtly uſurped by the ſlaves, which were in Battel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56329:94"/>the gain whereof, had coſt the generous Prince <hi>Arontus</hi> life. Sir ſaid <hi>Evander,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, he who hath done ſo many wonders under the name of <hi>Ariomant,</hi> is no other than your ſon <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and that <hi>Caliſtenus</hi> is his Couſin, who hath given no leſſe teſtimony of himſelf by his arms. That word ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled the joy of the Kings heart, as it ſhewed plainly in his countenance, and the good <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> raviſh'd to ſee their Majeſties ſo attentive to his diſcourſe, continued it as followeth.</p>
               <p>When they purpoſed to diſguiſe themſelves under thoſe two names, becauſe they had been too well known by thoſe of <hi>Taxilus,</hi> and <hi>Cleon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> which beſides had been ſo ſatal to them; they acquainted but their Gentlemen <hi>Almerin,</hi> and <hi>Neander,</hi> and my ſelf, with that ſecret, and cauſed <hi>Neander,</hi> (who was carried ſorely hurt into the beſieged City) to entreat me, that I would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to you obtain your favor for them, which they believed loſt: but my misfortune ſtay'd me on the way, in a remote place from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, where 'twas impoſſible to let you know what was become of me, or of the Princes. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they are yet with the King of <hi>Narſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> unknown to any ſave the fair <hi>Orazia,</hi> to whom your dear <hi>Anaxander,</hi> before he went from hence did vow himſelf. He afterwards told them, whatſoever he knew of the Hiſtory of the Loves of thoſe two generous Princes, which was likely to have made <hi>Alcidaris</hi> to ſend another Embaſſadour inſtantly to the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> but <hi>Evander</hi> diverted it: for ſeeing the War was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56329:94"/>ended, he aſſured the King, that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, at ſoon as <hi>Arontus</hi> Funerals were ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, for which they had under ſtood ſo many ſad preparation were making, in the City of <hi>Bati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King and Queen, then ezpect <hi>Pirobus</hi> his return, who could not be long ere he came, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſend him inſtantly back again in caſe they learnt that ſome new obſtacle ſtayed thoſe two Hero's in <hi>Narſinga.</hi> And to expreſſe the great contentment which they had received from <hi>Evanders</hi> news, and the other great ſervices he had done them, they gave him the Government of <hi>Bazain,</hi> which had of late been vacant, and as ſoon as the good old man had a little repoſed himſelf at <hi>Campanel,</hi> he departed by the King and Queens leave, to take poſſeſſion of it, promiſing to be with them again by that time <hi>Pirobus</hi> ſhould be returned, to reſolve with their Majeſties of what were beſt to be done for <hi>Anaxanders</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: for they were already reſolved fully, to give <hi>Orazia</hi> to him, in caſe that <hi>Pirobus</hi> had obtained the promiſe of her, and thought the change would not be unacceptable to the King of <hi>Narſingas,</hi> who had been witneſs of the fair deeds of their young Prince.</p>
               <p>Not above three daies after, the good <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> arrival at <hi>Bazain,</hi> about the evening, out of the Port guard came to tell him, that there was arrived a forein Veſſel weather beaten, &amp; ſeemed to be rather forced in by contrary winder, than come voluntary, wherein were two Cavalliers of good countenance, who craved leave to refreſh
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56329:95"/>themſelves in the Town, the moſt eminent of them was in ill caſe, being hurt in divers places of his body. Now by reaſon that place was of great importance to the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> they accuſtomed to keep a good guard, and to ſuffer none to enter, whoſe name, and quality and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs thither was not known, and becauſe thoſe two Gentlemen who arrived then newly in that Veſſel, being ignorant of the cuſtom, had refuſed to name themſelves, advertiſement was given the Governor, and his farther pleaſure deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Evander</hi> imagining, that it might happily be the two young Princes, his Pupels, who it may be, would not diſcover themſelves, till they came to Court, and ſurpriz: all people, he went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the Haven, and borded the Bark, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he found a young Knight lain all his length up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Mattereſſe, who althuogh he ſeemed greatly ſuffering by his hurts, which the tempeſt, had augmented, ſhewed notwithſtanding, a certain majeſty in his eyes and face, which made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced of all that ſaw him. <hi>Evander</hi> knew well enough, that twas ſome perſonage of note; and as he was extremely full of charity, and hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable, ſeeing the Gentleman who accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, would not tell his name, he thought however that the laws of civility did command and oblige his ſuccour, and to offer them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Town, but his Caſtle alſo, for their better accomodation. The ſtrangers accepted his offer, and ſo much care was had of him, that was hurt; as that in eight, or ten daies, he gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ſignes of an approaching health. Now,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56329:95"/>as he was very generous, and infinitely ſenſible of the good entertainment, and uſage ſhewn him by <hi>Evander,</hi> her thought he could not do leſſe in gratitude, than diſcover himſelf unto him, that he might know he had obliged <hi>Liſimantus;</hi> that vallorous <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> who had got ſo great a fame, and whoſe glorious name was renowned through all <hi>Aſia.</hi> Poor <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> how much had it been better, that thou hadſt not diſcovered thy ſelf, than to have payed ſo dearly for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor given thy excellent vertues, at thy firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, at leſt ſhouldeſt thou have been contented to have told thy name, without particulars of thy quarrel, which will ſet thee into the ſtrangeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, thou yet ever ſaweſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Evander,</hi> knowing that this ſtranger was the valiant <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> who had ſo worthily ſerved the King of <hi>Zeylar,</hi> and who ſo lately had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd ſo brave exploits in the Kingdom of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinga,</hi> had a double cauſe of being glad not only, for that he had it in his power to oblige a man of that condition, but that the aſſured himſelf, he ſhould learn news of <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and <hi>Piroxenus</hi> under the borrowed names of <hi>Ariomant,</hi> and <hi>Caliſtenus:</hi> but before he enquired, ſeeing that the Cavallier diſpoſed himſelf to recount unto him his adventure, and how after being ſo grievouſly hurt he came to the Port of <hi>Bazain:</hi> being very glad to be enformed, willingly gave his attenſion, and <hi>Liſimantus</hi> innocently began his diſcoarſe, without conſidering what manner of man he was to ſpeak unto, or what kinde of people he was to have to do with.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:56329:96"/>
               <p>Know (ſaid he) moſt reverend father, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my triumph over the King of <hi>Maldives,</hi> and if I had ſet all the Iſland of <hi>Zeylan</hi> at quiet, and been very helpful to the King of <hi>Narſingas</hi> peace, I quitted the Wars; and finding again in <hi>Batica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the only object of my paſſion, that adorable <hi>Liſimena,</hi> who had alwaies payed my love with ingratitude, and but whoſe name, I well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I ſhall alone poſſeſs, my flames renewed, and I felt my ſelf ſo to the quick ſollicited by my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous deſires, as I uſed all manner of ſubtilties, and invention to be in private with her: but ſhe ungrateful, who never ſufficiently acknowledge the ſervices which I have done her Crown, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting her diſdains, as my pains grew, inſtead of enduring me neer her, as my fidelity alone ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged her enough, rebuking and repelling who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſpake to my advantage, ſhe at length com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the moſt notable Treaſon againſt me, that was ever contrived againſt a miſerable Lover.</p>
               <p>There was in the King of <hi>Narſinga</hi> Court, a young Knight of Perſia, very accompliſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and worthy of great praiſe, who having by much induſtry the honor to be known by her, was notwithſtanding, preferred before my long and faithfull ſervices. I underſtood by a little Page of the Princeſſers that every night, he was brought ſecretly into her company, and ſpent ſix hours together with her, and how that ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Princeſs breathed nought but love for him: I will not deny, but that hereat, ſo jealous a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſuch ſort tranſported me, as not able to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56329:96"/>endure the happineſſe of that Rival I waited for him on an evening, where he vſed to paſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his amorous randezvous, and not able for my anger to underſtand his reaſons, I call'd him inſtantly to fight with me. <hi>Evander</hi> who with impatience looked that he ſhould name that young Knight, and finding that he was too long about it, interrupting him, demanded it. His name was <hi>Ariomant,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Liſimantus;</hi>) and well ſaid <hi>Evander,</hi> full of fear, what is become of him, I ſlew him, ſaid <hi>Liſimantus;</hi> and truly I have ſince lamented it, for a more valiant Knight I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met.</p>
               <p>He was about to continue on his diſcourſe, and tell them how after the death of <hi>Ariontant,</hi> whom he verily believed was ſlain, (becauſe <hi>Zenobus</hi> had aſſured him, that he ſaw him ſtretched out in his blood without warmth, or motion) being in but little better caſe himſelf, he was carried to a Bark, which attended him, and how thinking to avoid the coaſt of <hi>Zeylan,</hi> to ſhun the King of <hi>Narfinga</hi> his anger, whoſe Edict they had broken, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winde ariſing, which begot a furious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, had caſt them on the Coaſt of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> neer the Haven of <hi>Bazain.</hi> He was (I ſay) about to have recounted all theſe particulars, but that he was prevented by an accident which did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize him, and which no leſſe a mazed all that were about him, that himſelf; for at the recital of <hi>Ariomants</hi> death, <hi>Evander</hi> fell into a ſwound, on <hi>Liſimantus</hi> bed. They all ignorant of the reaſon of this ſuddain change, threw water in his face, and when he was come to himſelf, which a
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:56329:97"/>deep ſigh, cry'd out my friends, we have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the murtherer of your and my Maſter, and uttering theſe words, he gave plain evidence of a ſecond weakneſſe which grew on him; but being prevented by the ready help adminiſtred. Unhappy, and moſt cruel hoſpitallity (ſaid he) we ſhew kindeneſſe, and are civil unto one, who vaunts, that he hath cut our Princes throat, and who unjuſtly ſtirred his courage, and without cauſe provoked it; Let the wicked man be ſet ſafe (added he) and ſeaze upon his ſecond in the quarel; and as they are, let them be inſtantly conveighed towards the King, that even him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf may order what he pleaſe concerning them.</p>
               <p>Immediately the guard that was with <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> bound the poor <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> as he lay in bed ſo weak, but half recovered of his hurts, and ſeaz'd on <hi>Zenobus</hi> as well, whom with his friend they put into a Chariot, to carry them without delay to the City of <hi>Catupanel,</hi> where the King of <hi>Cambaya</hi> was. The people of <hi>Bazain</hi> when they knew that thoſe two priſoners which paſſed in the Chariot, had ſlain their Prince <hi>Anaxander,</hi> for the acceptable news of whoſe ſafety, they had lately made Bonefires, were ſo provoked, as had it not been for <hi>Evanders</hi> authority which reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, I verily believe they had ſtoned to death thoſe two unhappy ones or elſe diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred them alive.</p>

               <p>As ſoon as that magnanimous Prince had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Pirobus</hi> his demand, and that he had ſent him back, laden with preſents, and honors, and having no more to do in the Province of <hi>Canara,</hi> and finding that notwithſtanding the ſtrict ſearch of the Combatants, no news was to be had; after having placed a new Governor over <hi>Baticalus,</hi> in <hi>Zenobus</hi> his ſtead, he departed with his whole Court, but carried with him, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and wrath againſt thoſe, who with ſo much impudence had violated his Edict, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd where ever they were found, to puniſh them with rigor.</p>
               <p>The fair <hi>Orazia,</hi> who ſaw him willfull in that bloody reſolution, was much diſquieted, and her heart troubled, with divers, and ſundry motions, when ſhe perceiv'd the Court drew neer to <hi>Saradins</hi> Caſtle, wherein was hid, the richeſt treaſure of her ſoul: if on the one ſide, her fear of his diſcovery did trouble her, the pleaſure of her hope to ſee him, was ſo acceptable, as both compar'd, her joy was greater than her ſorrow, and her hope prevail'd above her fear. At worſt, ſhe thought the danger of his being found in that place, would not be great, becauſe it would be eaſie for her to prove his birth, as well by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rintus</hi> declaration, whoſe letter ſhe kept, as by <hi>Liſimena's</hi> teſtimony, who had heard all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of his life. However, though ſhe found
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56329:98"/>much ſafety in all theſe proofs, ſhew was not with out fear, when the King whom ſhe ſaw ſo ſevere entred the Caſtle, ſhe at firſt imagined, that ſome of <hi>Saradins</hi> people who had ſeen the two Princes comming, might for hope of recompence betray them: but ſhe was ſoon aſſured by the Maſter of the houſe, who anſwered for the truth of thoſe that guarded them, and who promis'd ſhe ſhould ſee them, if ſhe might truſt one off her women, for they were lodged over her Chamber.</p>
               <p>He had forbidden the way to that retired part of the houſe, making the harbengers believe, that they were Store-houſes, where he had ſet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Houſhold-ſtuff, and reſerv'd it for himſelf alone, and thoſe who had care of the princes, and the way to go unto them when he pleaſed. In ſo much, as when night came, the Princeſſes, who would lye together they often did, feigning to be weary of their journey, retired betimes, and would not ſuffer any of their women to lie that night in their Chamber; they only call'd for a watch light, for <hi>Orazia</hi> ſeemed, as if ſhe would read in her bed. When they were laid, they ſent away their women, not daring to truſt any one of them, and when every body was aſleep, they roſe ſoftly, &amp; cloathed one the other, to go to <hi>Saradin,</hi> who expected them at the door, and was to conduct them, where the two Princes were; <hi>Orazia</hi> would never endure that any other ſhould have knowledge of that important ſecret, which ſhe would have conccaled even from her dear <hi>Liſimena,</hi> however well ſhe was aſſured of her faith fulneſs, had not her company been then ſo neceſſary to her.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:56329:99"/>
               <p>This fair ſtranger Princeſs, had never been at eaſe ſince <hi>Liſimantus</hi> combat; for as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid, ſhe Iov'd him ſecretly in her heart, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her glorious courage never ſuffered her to ſhew it; and for ſhe had underſtood nothing of him, ſhe feared ſomewhat worſe had beſaln him, than had to <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and what was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to her, was, that ſhe dar'd not openly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after him, beſides, that very few were able to ſay what had become of him: But <hi>Orazia</hi> promis'd her, to enquire of <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> who bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any other, could tell whiter hee were alive or not, being he, who had advanced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to purt them, and who had found them in the lamentable caſe, which I have told you. Each then caſt a robe about her, and fitted their hair as well as they could, and their naturall graces ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing all, that art could adde unto them, they thus went, to the ſick Princes Lodgings, where <hi>Saradin</hi> conducted them.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Anaxander</hi> ſaw appear before his eyes, the onely beauty of the world which hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored, accompanyed with her dear, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Liſimena:</hi> My Ladies (cryed he out) is it poſſible that you have done me this honor, &amp; take ſo much pains for a ſubject of ſo mean importance? Recover your ſelf once brave <hi>Anaxander,</hi> anſwered <hi>Orazia,</hi> and you ſhall ſee of what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance your health is to my contentment. But I conjure you to conceal your ſelf as much as you can, whiles you are in our Countreys; for the King my Father, to whom you will not yet diſcover your ſelf, thunders, extremely againſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56329:99"/>you; and my ſelf, as well for diverſion of his wrath, as that you might ſurprize him wholly at your return, have ſowen the newes of your death through all the Court. Were it true indeed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Anaxander,</hi> your only preſence, and words, comming from ſo fair a mouth in my favour, were ſufficient to reſtore me again to life. But, Madam, do not think that I can conceal my ſelf, however carefull I may be to do it, nor, do you think, that my wounds are ſecret, no more than thoſe which your fair eyes have cauſed in the bottom of my heart; ſince you are privy to my evils, I believe all the world is full of them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you only are to me conſiderable. But, ſaid he, ſmiling, and flriving to take the Princeſs hand to kiſs it, I believe, Madam, you are come hither of purpoſe, to tell me of the good fortune, which the marriage of my Brother <hi>Alcidaris</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes you, to whoſe merit you are dedicated; and that you do me the honour to viſit me, as your Brother in Law, rather than as your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; the Princeſs who could not endure jeſting upon that ſubject, I do not think, ſaid ſhe, with a cone more ſerious, that you have miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the anſwer I gave <hi>Pirobus,</hi> and which I by and by communicated to you by <hi>Saradin;</hi> to wit, that I accounted my ſelf too happy, in that heaven had ordained the moſt perfect and accompliſh'd Prince of <hi>Gouzarat</hi> to be my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; for you know better than I, that that praiſe can belong to man ſave your ſelf, and that having made me know the wants of <hi>Alcida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> I ſhould ſeperate my ſelf as far from his ſute, as you are from his ill behaviour.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anaxander</hi> could not forbear laughing, to ſee her juſtifie her ſelf ſo ſeriouſly, in thing, which ſhe had ſaid to his advantage, and finding, that ſhe was a little moved: How, Madam, ſaid he, would you have ſo ill an opinion of me, as to be perſwaded, that I ſhould think you guilty of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſot? I pray believe, I have too good a one of my ſelf, and that I have too many teſtimonies of your love, to imagine you were pleaſed with <hi>Alcidaris</hi> ſute; but I thought, that in talking of ſo ridiculous a man, a little ſport had not been out of ſeaſon; and to ſay the truth, although he be my Brother, I cannot think on the deſcription made me of him, without burſting with laughter.</p>
               <p>During their entertainment with ſuch like diſcourſe, the Princeſs of <hi>Zeylan</hi> entertained <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxenus,</hi> and without ſeeming to have any intereſt in <hi>Liſimantus</hi> ſafety, making him tell her every particular of the combat, ſhe underſtood, that he had been carried (very much hurt) aboord his bark, but that he thought him not in worſe plight than <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and that where ever he was, he thought him ſtill living. This aſſurance gave great cauſe of comfort to <hi>Liſimena,</hi> who in truth, feared nothing more in the world, than the death of that accompliſh'd Knight, who had performed as many brave actions, for the love of her, as of himſelf; beſides, that ſhe knew that laſt encounter grew, but from the extreme affection he bare her, which was grown to ſuch a paſs, as in his very deſpair he could endure norivals.</p>
               <p>They were all four, more than two houres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, having no other witneſs of their content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56329:100"/>but <hi>Saradin:</hi> but when there was a word of parting, ſorrow trod ſhort upon the heels of joy. And what ever means <hi>Orazia</hi> uſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble her diſpleaſure, it was ſo plain to ſee in her fair eyes, bedew'd with tears, as <hi>Anaxander</hi> could not reſtrain himſelf from ſeconding them with his, in that tender motion which did ſeaze him, and a thouſand times kiſſing that adorable Princeſſe hands, he made her as many proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of eternall conſtancy; then, in preſence of three witneſſes, they renewed with extreme, and reciprocall affection, their promiſes of mariage, which they had formerly made in <hi>Baticalus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the Gods to exterminate the firſt of them, that ſhould break faith.</p>
               <p>They being thus fortified by that mutuall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, finiſhed their adieus, wherein, <hi>Anaxan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> promiſed his Princeſſe, that believing himſelf to be able in a ſhort ſpace to depart from thence for <hi>Gouzarat,</hi> he would return ſooner than ſhe thought, for the accompliſhment of both their wiſhes. The night being well ſpent, the two fair Princeſſes returned to their Chamber, where they entertain'd themſelves untill day, which no ſooner appeared, but the King, who was already cloathed, cauſed them to be advertis'd that they ſhould make themſelves ready to depart, if they deſired to avoid the heat of the day, which the beginning threatned; they ſhut not their eyes all that night, and yet <hi>Orazia,</hi> deſiring nothing more in the world than that the King her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were departed from that Caſtle, where ſhe had never been in quiet; ſhe ſuddainly made her
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56329:101"/>ſelf ready, and having again ſent a new comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by <hi>Saradin</hi> to Prince <hi>Anaxander,</hi> ſhe aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (with <hi>Liſimena</hi>) her Chariot, and ſo follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings, ſhe little and little, loſt ſight of the Caſtle, which as long as ſhe was able ſhe kept within her eye.</p>
               <p>The amorous Prince, whom ſhe had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde her, paid full dearly for the pleaſure of her viſit; for he was ſo much moved by exceſſe of joy, which his Miſtreſſe preſence caus'd him, as he fell into a violent Feavor, which accident ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much retarded his recovery: but let us leave him to amendment by a long reſt, untill a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health grow on him: Lots likewiſe leave the King of <hi>Narſinga</hi> arrived at <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> where he did a thouſand honors to the Princeſſe <hi>Liſimena,</hi> who would not permit him to accompany her, any farther; and let us ſuffer that fair Princeſs to depart, who although ſhe returned to the King her father, and to an Iſland, which the Arabians In their tongue call the land of delights, and the Indians, the Paradiſe of the earth; and that over and above thoſe conſiderations, ſhe hoped to ſee her Love again there, could not chuſe but be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely afflicted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Let us I ſay, leave all theſe matters as they are, and return to <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and ſee that unfortunate Knight, whom <hi>Evander</hi> conducted to the great <hi>ALcidaris,</hi> arrive as <hi>Campanel,</hi> and who had unawares accus'd himſelf of <hi>Anaxanders</hi> death.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the King was told of that ſad news,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56329:101"/>it was as much as he could do to live for torrow. Unfortunate <hi>Anaxander</hi> (ſaid he,) muſt I loſe thee again the ſecond time, and be deceived ſo ſoon of the hope was given me, that I ſhould ſee thee yet alive? Ah, <hi>Evander,</hi> how unacceptably haſt thou vifited me? my rage was over, and I had dryed my tears, cauſed by the imaginary loſſe of my ſon, and thou haſt let me know his being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and his brave actions, but to increaſe my ſorrow for his death indeed.</p>
               <p>Great was his grief, but the Queens extream; That fair Princeſſe, who was but newly come from giving the Gods thanks, for the recovery of her only ſon whom ſhe had ſo lamented, touch'd to the quick by the ſenſe of that irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loſſe, and for that time loſing all patience, and accuſtom'd modeſty, could not for bear accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing heaven, and injuring its powers. Ye unjuſt gods (ſaid ſhe) whom too in vain I have invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, with ſo great fervency, and zeal for my ſons ſafety, I ſee plainly ye are deaf, that have not heard me: he that burns inſenſe on your Altars foully deceives himſelf, your power is but opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or have you any, it ſerves but to offend thoſe, that diſtreſſed, make their vows to you. Alas I had regain'd my dear child, but for invoking you, and you even ſince my vows, and prayers, have ſnatch'd him from me. I perceive, my dear <hi>Anaxander,</hi> that I have loſt thee for ever, I ſhall no more ſee thee in this world, and yet where ere thou art I am reſolv'd to ſeek thee, and die for ſorrow, if no other remedy: But ere that be, I mean to ſatiſfie thy good Angel, and ſince thy
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56329:102"/>murtherer is fallen into our hands, I promiſe thee to be revenged on him.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſorrows ſerved but to augment the Kings diſpleaſure, who was ſtrucken to the heart, as well may be a father who hath loſt the honor of his houſe, and hope of his Kingdom: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he was infinitely juſt, and generous, ſeeing it was that brave <hi>Liſimantus</hi> whom <hi>Evander</hi> had brought, whoſe known vallour was renowned every where, he thought it would be too great an act of baſneſſe, and inhumanity, to revenge his ſons death on him, who had ſlain him like a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant man in Duel, and unknown, but by a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed name, which he had taken; and thought it an action of a great King, to ſend him to the King of <hi>Zeylan</hi> without puniſhment, and ſeeing too, that <hi>Anaxander</hi> could not live by tother death.</p>
               <p>But however abſolute he was in his Kingdom, he could not then be Maſter, his Subjects too much loved the memory of their Prince, to ſuffer his murtherer to ſcape unpuniſhed whom they had in their cuſtody: And ſeeing that the great <hi>Alcidaris</hi> inclin'd to mercy, all the Judges aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelves ſuddainly, and ſeconding the Queens angry purpoſes, they haſtned <hi>Liſimantus</hi> judgement, and that very day condemned him to die. As for <hi>Zenobus,</hi> they judged him to a perpetual impriſonment, who had not ſcap'd ſo cheap, but that he averred himſelf overcome by <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> whom he aſſured them, he left alive, and weeping by his dead friend.</p>
               <p>When the ſentence of <hi>Liſimantus</hi> condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56329:102"/>was read unto him, that great and invincible courage, which had ſcorned death in all the ſhapes and forms it ever had appeared to him in, was ſhaken by that ſo ſevere and terrible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He fiercely look'd upon the bringer of thoſe cruel tidings, and his rage prevailing, in his ſenſe of that cruelty ſhewn on him: Thou wicked man (ſaid he,) who ſerv'ſt the fury of the moſt barbarous people of the world, haſt thou impudence enough to come and outrage me in the miſcrable condition I am in, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh with a ceremony, the injury prepared for my innocence? My name, which hath made ſo many Nations to tremble, and is ſo regarded through the <hi>Indes;</hi> ſhall it be ſo much ſcorn'd by you, as you will dare condemn me for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable action? Will ye be ſo unworthy, as to ſtain the memory of your Princes death, who did ſo valiantly defend himſelf, and make me bear ſo many marks of his courage? Can I believe I do converſe with men, where reigns ſo great in humanity. Where is that generous <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> whoſe praiſes are ſo ignorantly ſung throughout all <hi>Aſia?</hi> He ſuffers me to be a prey unto his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects fury, and endures that, after having led a life full of honor, I be put to a ſhameful death under his own eyes?</p>
               <p>The Officer, who was in truth a generous and compaſſionate man, and touched at the miſery of that famous Knight, reply'd thus to him. I come with ſorrow, brave <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> to execute the ſad commiſſion given me againſt you: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that my charge requires it of me, and that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56329:103"/>I muſt, whatever juſtice bids me. Were it, your ſafety did depend on me, you ſhould be ſoon made free; I have admired long your vertue, and however far from your profeſſion, I cannot but do reverence to men like you. But what, in this diſability wherein I am, can I tender you but vows unprofitable, and pray the gods to give you reſolution enough to bear your evill fortune pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently? Do not accuſe <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> he wiſhes you at liberty, and believe me, his ſubjects have haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your condemnation, but ſince they ſaw his nature willing to remit you; He is not this day maſter of his peoples wills, who are doubly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated againſt you, as well by the ſtrong moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Queen, as by their own reſentments.</p>
               <p>What manner of Country muſt it be, replyed <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> where the King is govern'd by his Subjects; he that forbids not evill, does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; and truly, though divine and humane Lawes, did not condemn <hi>Alcidaris</hi> cruelty, yet she honour he profeſſes ſhould perſwade him to defend me. He, to whom all power is given, ſhould ſhew it leſs than others, and you will g rant me, that your Prince uſes too inſolently his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and makes too poor a uſe of my calamity; Well, well, Death will deliver me from his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, but he ſhall not be freed from his neighbors blame. I will let him ſee, I can tell how to die, and that the croſſes of my fortune, are not able to ſhake my Reſolution, nor deject my Courage; 'Tis true, 'tis hard to part with life at ſo young an age: but 'twould be more intollerable if I feared Death; I know I live to dye, and that the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56329:103"/>very day of my Birth, nature ſets limits to my dayes; and beſides an unworthineſſe of heart, it were a folly in me, to fear what I cannot avoid; I have ſo often beheld Death, as my eyes are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, and I call the gods to witneſs, nothing aftoniſhes me, but the manner of my dying. I paſs the headsmans hands? ah, who ſoere thou art that look'ſt with pitty on me, and are touch'd with my misfortune, if thou have any credit with the King, or thoſe that ſeek my life, obtain of them, that either a Dagger, or poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſatisfie their cruelty? Excuſe me from the ſhame prepared for me, and permit not, that I outrage nature ſo much, as to deliver my ſelf out of their hands, which doubtleſſe I ſhould rather do, than to expect their puniſhment.</p>
               <p>This compaſſionate Officer was ſo touched, that the tears came in his eyes, at thoſe laſt words, and curſeda thouſand times, that day, wherein for his preferment, he was taken from his ordinary commerce with men, to be a Judge of their lives: he then drew near <hi>Liſimantus</hi> to comfort him, and to offer him all the aid was in his power; and however dark the Priſon might at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance ſeem, yet, by a little ſtay and accuſtoming the fight thereto, it was caſie enough for one man to know an other by his face; and therefore <hi>Liſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus</hi> who thought he knew the ſound of that voice which ſpake unto him, but could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly call him to mind, ſeeing him ſo near, knew him perfectly, not having ſeen him in twelve or thirteen years before; and crying out, My Father, ſaid he, caſting his arms about his neck,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56329:104"/>is it poſſible that you are that good, and vertuous <hi>Eurimedes,</hi> who brought me into the world, and whoſe name I once bare? If my eyes do not deceive me, ſay, what occaſion brought you hither, and what ſtrange fortune made you leave the Trade you drove at <hi>Diu,</hi> to weare the gown, that you might condemn your own Son to death?</p>
               <p>The good <hi>Eurimedes,</hi> (for he it was indeed) was ſo aſtoniſht at theſe words, as remaining a good ſpace without ſpeaking; O yee immortall Gods, ſaid he, what do I hear, what ſee I, what miracle is this? Which <hi>Liſimantus</hi> hearing, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confirm'd in what he beleeved: Oh my Father (ſaid he) I know you without doubt, and ſee, the Gods for puniſhment of my forſaking your houſe, and raiſing my ſelf beyond my duty, in forein parts, and ſhaming my birth, which I have till this time conceald from all the world, will have me once appear before you, for my more Confuſion, and to have my Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from your mouth; O how juſtly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune deales thus with me, and how reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably may ſhe repent her of her favours ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally beſtowed on me? I have treated in Equality with Kings, I have pratled with the faireſt Princeſſes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> I have commanded ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, I have every day layd new foundations for vanity, and conceiv'd new hopes of greatneſſe, I have reckoned of the goods of fortune as mine own; and now, ſhe takes them, not only all, at once from me, but Entrenches on the honor I have gotten with my ſword, and does not ſpare my life, whereof ſhe formerly hath ſeem'd to be

                  <hi>Eurimedes,</hi> who by this time doubted no more that it was the very child which he had loſt, and precious pledg which <hi>Pirobus</hi> had made him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly reſponſable for; and for his better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction pray'd him to let him ſee his right arm naked, where finding the Arms of <hi>Gouzarat</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and his conſcience troubled for what he was compelled long ago to do: he caſt himſelf upon his knees before <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him for his lawfull Lord; Great Prince, (ſaid he to him) if you have been elevated by your courage, and ambition, if you have treated equally with Princes, and if you have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Armies, you have done nothing unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your birth, or unworthy of your illuſtrious parents. Know my Lord, that you are ſon unto the great <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> and only to avoid the blame, which I had had, for not producing you, being required of me, when you fled from my houſe, I was fain to imprint the Royal arms of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya</hi> in my childs arm, which was ſet on yours, to know you by, when you ſhould be taken out of my hands; That child my Lord, whom I dare not own, is he, who unjuſtly at this day, holds your room, and for whom, all the Court and the King himſelf have ſo little good opinion: I make
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56329:105"/>you this comeſſion with ſhame, and I, who am his father, ask your pardon, if neceſſity enforcing me, I have ſo ill ſupplyed your place. <hi>Liſiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> ſurpriz'd with wonder, and aſtoniſhment, cauſed <hi>Eurimedes</hi> to riſe, and prayed him to tell him what he knew of the truth of his Hiſtory; which he did from the beginning to the end, and recounted to him, how <hi>Alcidaris</hi> got him on the Queen <hi>Bernica</hi> his firſt wife; and forced by his paſſionate love unto QUeen <hi>Anaxarete,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his ſute, becauſe he had a ſon, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to ſuffer his fatherly affection, to give place to the violence of his love: in concluſion, he recited to him, from point to point, how <hi>Pirobus</hi> had truſted him to his education, that he changed his name <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> into his own <hi>Eurimedes,</hi> leſt in progreſſe of time, he might be known for the Kings, and that he might be bred among his children, and paſſe for one of them, untill he ſhould be called to Court, and uſed as himſelf, the heir of the Crown. But my Lord added he, when you had ſtollen from me, becauſe <hi>Pirobus</hi> had exceedingly recommended you to my wife, and ſelf, and that we received a great pay yearly for you, we could not doubt but that you were of great extraction; in ſo much, as for the fear of being puniſhed if you were found wanting, as for the loſſe of a great Penſion which we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; I thought it beſt, together with my wife (having ſeen after what manner, the Arms of <hi>Cambaya</hi> had been printed on your arm) to do the like to one of our children, who was very neer your age, and ſhape, and colour'd hair, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56329:105"/>is the ſame who at this day, draws all the Court after him, and thinks, he is the only heir of all thoſe Kingdoms which expect you. Indeed, had he been of a better inclination, and of other breeding than he is, my fortune had been grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; But the King taking him for his ſon, and believing that he got with me thoſe evil cuſtoms and habits, which he hath by nature only; he thought it ſufficient to take me from my traſſique, and give me an Office, which was then vacant in the Criminal Chamber of Juſtice, in <hi>Campanel,</hi> wherein I am Commiſſary general, of all Crimes againſt the Crown. In truth, the Office was but too good for me, and I accounted it ſtill honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, untill this fatall day of your condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein, I have diſhonored both it, and my ſelf, by adhering to the beaſtlineſſe of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panelens, who covet to glory in the death of one of their Princes, by the ignominious loſſe of the other: but by the gods aſſiſtance I intend to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, I will go inſtantly and declare my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the King, and though it be a ſad intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to know you were your only brothers homicide, not knowing him, he muſt in ſinte be comforted, that you are living, and his lawful race not quite extinct. In uttering theſe words without giving leaſure to the Prince to reply, he left him in his priſon, with new diſquiets for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſlain a brother of ſo generous, and good a nature; and preſently went to King <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> at whoſe feet he caſt himſelf, and made him this diſcourſe.</p>

Since, ſaid the King, thou haſt reveal'd the ſecret as ſoon as thou haſt known it, tis like thou hadſt no malice in thy action; riſe, I forgive thee, on condition thou bring me my ſon, and hide no part of his adventures from me.</p>
               <p>Alas (Sir) reply'd <hi>Eurimedes,</hi> that brave <hi>Liſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus,</hi> who hath been the terrour of the <hi>Indes,</hi> and who is at this preſent contrary to your will, kept in your priſons, and a criminal condemn'd to death, is he of whom I ſpeak, and who hath had the honour to be born from you. Ah ye gods, (cryed the King) is it poſſible? can I be ſo happy as to be father of ſo generous a child? but
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56329:107"/>what ſay I happy, ſhould I be ſo unſcrable, as to have begotten him, who hath murthered his own brother, and for a curſed point of honor hath for ever raviſht my dear <hi>Anaxander</hi> from me, the very hope of my old daies? Unhappy father that I am, ſhall I be alwaies ſo ill us'd of Fortune, as to be reduc'd to complain even of her favors? and ſhall I never receive one benefit from her hands, which is not follow'd by a thouſand miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs? I thought I had but one ſon, good man, and I have twice bewail'd his death, and he, whom contrary to my expectation I have found again, ſeems to appear, but to torment me more, and grieve me for the others loſſe.</p>
               <p>Ah (Sir) ſaid <hi>Eurimedes,</hi> inter rupting his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintt, while I am ſpeaking, the poor Prince is in deſpair, for knowing that <hi>Anaxander</hi> was his brother; and I am conſident, he would as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have died himſelf, and would be glad to buy him again with his own life. Without more ado, (ſaid the King,) let his Iront be ſtruck off, and be he no longer injur'd; which way ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the gods have ſent him me, I am obliged to receive him, conſidering his innocence of his brothers death; and that he hath ſuch reaſon to ſhare with me in the affliction, which without purpoſe he hath cauſed me. Then inſtantly not willing to publiſh this news, he ſecretly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Captain of his guard, to take him out of priſon, and bring him to him, at his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
               <p>This Prince accompliſh'd, whom till that time, the King would not ſee, was yet very pale, as well
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56329:108"/>by reaſon of the wounds whereof he was ſcarce healed, as for the hard uſage he had ſhewn him in the priſon; yet was that want ſo ſupplyed, by the gracefulneſſe of his behaviour, as though he came into the Kings Chamber with a ſorrowful countenance, it hindred not, that all the Court admired him. As ſoon as he entred the room, he kneeled on the ground, and witneſſed ſo much ſorrow to the King his father, for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune befallen him, as that his Majeſty was more afflicted for his grief that for his own. Son ſaid he, embracing him, thoſe are the ordinary ſhock; of fortune, you are not the firſt that hath unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly deſtroyed his own blood, the ſtages are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly full of like examples, and not to ſeek ſo far, we have at home, and with our neighbours, others like them. Be comforted, my child, heaven cannot be angry for your innocent offence, it ſelf is more than you guilty, which knowing your deſign, did not divert it; Believe at worſt, the gods will pardon you becauſe I do, and for your preſence, paies me for all loſſes, and afflictions paſt.</p>
               <p>Ah, (Sir) reply'd <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> can you behold a wretch? which hath ſo highly outrag'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? a murtherer of his own blood, an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable monſter, which cannot with a thouſand deaths, expiate the crime he hath committed? He had inlarged his complaints, had not the King interrupted him, and by his redoubled embraces, and his ſolid reaſons overcome his earneſtneſs in condemning himſelf; and then ſettling a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his ſpirits, and by degrees changing diſcourſe,

However, to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56329:109"/>ſatisfie the dence you have, to know how I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd honor, and advantages abroad, I will tell you in a few words; that though I thought my ſelf <hi>Eurimedes</hi> his ſon, and kept in equal breed and habit with his own in the City of <hi>Diu,</hi> I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare not, in thoſe tender years to aſpire to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, and more generous exerciſes than he caus'd us to be taught. If I ſaw a goodly horſe, I long'd to be upon him; I delighted alwaies more to ſee a ſword than a feather; and <hi>Eurimedes</hi> here preſent, can aſſure you, they found me oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the Manage, and the Fencing ſchool, than at my Grammar. Beſides all this, I had ſo ſtrong a paſſion to be gone out of that little City, where I was ſhut up, to ſee ſtrange parts, which I had heard of, as being one day walking a good way off the City, on the Sea ſhoar, a private ſhip, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there landed, I was not at all aſtoniſhed when they took me, becauſe they us'd me kindely, and after having much prais'd my prettyneſſe and beauty, they promis'd, they would give me to their King, who was one of the moſt generous Princes of the world.</p>
               <p>In part they kept their words with me, for indeed they carried me into <hi>Zeilan,</hi> which was the place of their birth: but inſtead of making a preſent of me, as they had promiſed, they ſold me, to one of the greateſt Lords, of that fair Iſland. They perſwaded him, I was a poor Child, whom they had found, and bred up for Charity, becauſe ſeeing me ſo pretty, and ſpritely, they might hope to make ſomewhat of me, and made me believe, that if I would gain my ſelf a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56329:110"/>fortune, and be bred among the great one, ſhould ſay as they did. This Lord, who was called <hi>Arbiran,</hi> found me ſo pleaſing, for my words, and actions, which (he ſaid) were more than of a Child, and ſeeming as it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what noble, that at the end of three Weekes, or a Moneth, that he had had me, having put me into very good Clothes, commanded me to wait on him to the Palace: and ask'd me, whether I would talk as well before the King, as I had done to him. I had at that time a great liberty of the <hi>Arabick</hi> tongue, which is the Mother Language of my reputed father, and which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with eſtimation through all <hi>India,</hi> in ſo much, as Iaſſuring him, that I would do yet better, and that he ſhould diſcern as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as between the King, and himſelf, he was ſo touch'd with the grace I uttered thoſe words, as he acquainted the Queen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, who deſired to ſee me, which having done, ſhe would have me preſently from him, to place me with the Princeſſe <hi>Liſimena,</hi> her onely daughter, who at that time was not above ſix years of age.</p>
               <p>Although I were unknown to all men, (becauſe I rather chuſed to confirm what the Pirats had ſaid of me, than confeſſe I was a Merchants Son) my face, and the gentleneſſe of my actions, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my diſcourſe, begot me much honour from all people, and to ſuch a degree, as they held me fit to wear the Princes livery, wherein I was the firſt, and only Page a pretty while. And becauſe I had according to the Pirates, aſſured
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56329:110"/>them, that my Parents were as unknown unto me, as my name, the Queen named me <hi>Euribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> which in that Country language ſignifics a found Child.</p>
               <p>The Princeſſe, who at that innocent age had found the ſecret of making her ſelf feared, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt beautifull thing that was ever ſeen, and already raviſh'd all eyes, with admiration of ſo many graces, and perfections, as nature had beſtowed upon her. She commanded me to be ever near her, and to follow her alwaies, as well becauſe ſhe ſaw every body lov'd me, as for I was the firſt Creature, over whom ſhe had an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power. But alaſs, ſhe in time knew, that ſhe had got much more than ſhe deſired: I found my ſelf ſo ready for her commandt, and took ſo great contentment in her ſervice, as although I had known at that time my extraction, I ſhould have held my ſelf very happy in the quality of her Slave, I was as ready to obey her, as ſhe gracefull in commanding me; and though, that age did not allow me knowledge, of the force of Love; I could not but perceive, my cares, and my affections paſſed common duties. She had perceived it, as well as I, when on a day that ſhe had praiſed me for ſomewhat I had done to her minde: <hi>Euribaldus</hi> (ſaid ſhe to me) well done, but I fear this paſſion will not laſt (Madam ſaid I) I purpoſe it ſhall not end but with my life; And were my happineſs ſuch, as to be the greateſt Monarch of the world, I would deſire to be ever at your feet, nor ſhould any conſideration looſe me from your ſervice; Truly, ſaid ſhe, your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices

               <p>Although ſhe were: but full ten years of age, her ſpirit forward, and her judgement formed, which ſupply'd the want of years, made her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to apprehend my words; I obſerved, that when ſhe would reply, ſhe ſtuck twice or thrice upon the utterance, an aſſured note that ſhe had underſtood me. I believe her firſt purpoſt was, to anſwer me ſharply, to teach me more reſpect afterwards, and not to aſpire to things out of my reach: but that thought was ſoon ſweetned by a feigned ignorance, that ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood my diſcourſe proceeded from the true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I already bare her. Thus you ſee how I took boldneſſe betimes, to diſcover a thing unto her, which I did not underſtand: For how, at
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56329:111"/>thirteen years of age could I apprehend the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of one of the moſt powerfull Gods? In truth, I knew not yet, what Love was: but I knew that <hi>Liſimena</hi> was the ſweeteſt object of mine eyes, and the ſole thing in the world, which could pleaſe me. I knew well enough, that I ought not to love her, and that my inclination was extravagant, and raſh: but when I thought to divert my ſelf from it, a certain power recall'd me, which I could not chuſe but yeeld to.</p>
               <p>Growing in age, I increaſed in affection, and my reſpect augmented in ſuch ſort, as I dared not ſtedfaſtly behold <hi>Liſimena,</hi> becauſe the Love, which day by day, did kindle in my eyes, had without doubt diſcovered the paſſion, which my minde formed; and I feared to undo my ſelf, by laying it open to her, as well by the loſſe of my fortune, as contentment, which had been quite taken from me, if I had been ſeparated from her ſervice. However, I could not ſo well conceal my ſelf, nor keep in my inclination, but that ſomewhat at length appeared in my face; I loſt by little and little, that gayety, which was ſo naturall unto me, I became melancholick and grave: in ſhort, I dayly gave viſible ſignes, of a growing affection, and reſpectful, which I one day took the boldneſs to let her ſee, that cans'd it, in ſuch manner as I mean to tell you.</p>
               <p>I was retired all alone, into the Wardrope, where, having diſcovered by a chink of the door, that the Princeſſe came to obſerve what I did, feigning not to ſee her, I caſt my ſelf upon a bed,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56329:112"/>and drew a Handkerchief out of my pocket to wipe my eyes, bedewed with tears; a fegining, which became the innocency of my age, and uttered theſe Words, ſo, as to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>O divine <hi>Liſimena,</hi> why am not I permitted to adore you? and why hath Nature given me the courage to love you, not giving me conditions worthy to deſerve a like of affection? But I, what am I, that preſume to ſigh for you? poor, and miſerable Creature, a deſpicable, found Child, the refuſe of the world, and Fortunes Shittlecock. Truly, tis a handſome thing, that ſhould ſuffer my deſires, to carry me ſo high, to make my fall the more ſhamefull; it becomes me well, to look amorouſly on her, whom the greateſt Princes behold with reſpect, and who, by the force of her beauty is able to bring down the greateſt courages of <hi>Aſia</hi> Die yee incon ſiderate thoughts, yee are ſo faulty, as but for letting yee take place in my ſoul, I do confeſſe I have deſerved death. When I had ended thoſe words, with a deep ſigh, drawn from the bottom of my hear, I heard a noyſe at the door, and inſtantly riſing, I perceiv'd it was that divine Princeſſe, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been on her knees, to conſider me the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and when ſhe found her ſelf ſurpriz'd by any diſcourſe, meaning to ſteal ſoftly away, ſhe could not do it ſo quietly, but that her knee in riſing knock againſt the door: that noiſe made her double her pace, and ſhe fled as faſt as ſhe could into her Cloſet, for fear, left I ſhould take notice of the curioſity ſhe had had, to ſee and hear my diſcourſe.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:56329:112"/>
               <p>That flight of hers, put me at firſt into a great fear; for I thought ſhe had gone to declare my childiſh paſſion to the Queen, and make ſport of it, through the Corut: however, ſhe ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and in truth, her diſcreet concealing it, is the only note that I think I ever had of her good will to me, which never the leſſe, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but from her perfect judgment.</p>
               <p>Since that time, ſhe hath been more grave to me, and hath not talk'd ſo often with me, as ſhe was wont, but I have lov'd her ſtill; and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, by I know not what hope, becauſe ſhe had not diſocvered me, I would not ſee my condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in her ſilence. I therefore perſiſted, and to make my ſelf worthy of the high reſolution I had taken, I began to be touched with honour, and to look upon the deeds of thoſe who were of greateſt credit in Court, that I might get re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by their example.</p>
               <p>The thing which facilitated my means of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving to the glory I pretended, was, that after the Queens death, who loved me, and was my only ſupport, finding my ſelf uſed with leſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by the chief of her houſhold than I had been while ſhe lived, and my little courage obliging me to put my ſelf forward, by how much more I found they neglected me; A certain young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, one of the Princeſſes Governeſſes ſons, who had a mind to anger me, and us'd to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56329:113"/>whereat he growing very angry, Thou art too ſaucy (ſaid he) in a tone more grave, and ſerious, and I will teach thee to know thy duty, not to make compariſons; thou miſtakeſt thy ſelf too much, and ſo as thou haſt forgot thy own name: For thou ſhouldſt call to mind <hi>(Euribel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus)</hi> that thou art but a found child; Tis tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

As ſoon as ſaw him fallen, I put all my ſurety in my heels, and ſaved my ſelf in my firſt Maſter <hi>Arbirans</hi> houſe, who with open arms receiv'd me.</p>
               <p>This valiant Knight, and the greateſt of the whole Kingdom, had ſtill kept the good will he bare me even from my infancy: in ſomuch, as when he had heard my reaſons which he found juſt, he kept me a while private, until he had juſtified me to the King, of whom, in ſpite of the mother, and friends of the dead, which were of quality, he obtain'd my pardon. In ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of this good turn, I ever after was ſo obſervant of him, and ſhewed ſo great a zeal, and affection to his ſervice, as I can truly ſay, he loved me before any of his kindred, and made me ſo conſiderable in the Court, by the honor of that friendſhip, which all people took notice of, that I was reſpected of both ſexes; for <hi>Arbiran,</hi>

But truly all theſe honors were indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to me, in the only conſideration I had to be acceptable unto <hi>Liſimena:</hi> That fair Princeſſe nouriſh'd ſtill within me the ſervant deſires which conſumed me, and by ſo much the more entertain'd me in my amorous diſquier, by how much my reſpect depriv'd me of the means of ſeeing her, for fear of offering an unwellcome and ſad object to her Governeſſe eyes, who could not forget the death of her ſon: if ſometimes I met her in the Palace, I ſaluted her a far off with certain geſtures, which equally witneſſed my paſſion to ſerve her, and my fear to diſcontent her, and that beauty, who had ſtill the ſigns of my fooliſh paſſion freſh in her memory, look'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from me, whether out of ſcorn or judgment I cannot tell.</p>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56329:114"/>which was able to undo his Subjects, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite them from their lawful obedience unto him; he made an Edict, by which he proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med guilty of high Treaſon to his, &amp; the Divine Majeſty, all thoſe that ſhould be convicted of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to thoſe new opinions, and as ſuch, he ordained, that their goods ſhould be conſiſcate, and baniſhed within a months ſpace out of his Country.</p>
               <p>There were a number of thoſe Infidels dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Port <hi>Tanadarus,</hi> who as ſoon as they heard a breath of this Ordinance, ſeiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King of <hi>Zeyland,</hi> gave a generous anſwer to that Embaſſador; that he very much wondred at his Maſters extravagancy and raſhneſſe, who Impertinently thruſt himſelf into the knowledge of his Subjects affairs; that, if his threat did ſtir him unto any thing, it ſhould be, to a greater ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor towards thoſe, who without any good ground, had miſerably forſaken their fathers gods: and for his own particular, he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly depart out of his Countries, leſt his anger might make him violate the Laws of Nations, and in his perſon, puniſh his Maſters inſolence, whom he would prevent. That Embaſſador who look'd not at all, for ſo rough an anſwer, ſo exaſperated the King his Maſters courage, which was enough irritated before, that he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent forth a hundred Ships and more from the Port of the <hi>Maldives,</hi> to go ſuccour the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of <hi>Tanadarus.</hi>

               <p>This open and generous Prince, who till that time had arm'd himſelf with no defence, gave liberty to all ſort of people as accuſtomed, to be in his Palace, where, four of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

It is your on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nobleneſſe, Sir, which makes the ſinall ſervice I was obliged to do you, acceptable, although at hazard of my life: the gods forbid, that I ſhould ever pretend to deſerve an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from you, for what my duty bound me to, and for a thing I ought my ſelf; tis only Fortune whom you are to thank, for having happily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt mine eyes, unto the murtherer, to turn his ſtroak, and I a ſſure my ſelf, there is not any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject you have, but would have ſhewn the ſame zeal to ſave you, admitting him the ſame good fortune.</p>
               <p>The King ſeeing how gracefully I refuſed the good he offered me; Obſerve truly, ſaid he, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards <hi>Arbiran,</hi> a great deal of youth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a great deal of vertue, and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not that this ſervice ſhall be unrewarded.

Truly anſwer'd he, thy requeſt is too noble, and too juſt to be refuſed, I know not who thy parents are, but who ſo ere thou art, I ſee that Nature hath not been ſo much a ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam to thee as thou thinkſt, being ſo vertuouſly diſpos'd. From this time, I declare thee a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; and ſeeing that Gentility is a quality depending on another, and which may happen to thy contrary, I mean a vicious man, and of no worth; be it known, in caſe thy birth be mean, that I account it far below the quality thy vertue gives thee. And, that henceforth, thy name may not be only in the eſteem, but reverence of my Subjects, my only daughter ſhall name thee, and being bred her Page, thou ſhalt henceforth be her Knight. Preſently, he commanded me to follow him to the Princeſſe Chamber, who by the Kings command, gave me the ſweet name of <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> which ever ſince I have enjoyed, and did me the honor to girt on my ſword, which I have ever ſince imployed in that Kingdoms ſervice.</p>
               <p>The fair Princeſſe was a little ſurprized when the King commanded her that thing; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſhe thought upon my love, and though no creature know there of but herſelf, ſhe could not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56329:116"/>chuſe but bluſh, finding ſhe was oblig'd to ſhew me ſo much favour: but verily my ſenſe was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from hers, and if I had not ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd all my force to help me in that manſport, I had given apparent ſigns of my paſſion to the whole Court.</p>
               <p>I reſiſted (in truth) my firſt motions of joy, with a great deal of conſtancy, as well, when ſhe gave me her fair name, as when ſhe girded on my ſword: but, when according to the order of their ceremonies, I was commanded to kiſſe her fair hand naked, which had done me ſo much honor, and that Love had emboldned me to kiſſe that beautious living Marble; I confeſſe that all my ſenſes were troubled, and yet for the preſent I ſo contain'd my ſelf, as ſhe alone, could take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my rapture.</p>
               <p>Since that happy day, I had more liberty of ſeeing her and ſpeaking with her, as one who was her creature and Knight, made with her own hand, could every day go ſeek imployment of her: but foreſeeing that the ſervice I would do her, was not what ſhe deſired of me, I oftentimes conſtrain'd the violence of my deſires, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to diſpleaſe her, did forbear to wait on her.</p>
               <p>In the meanwhile, the King cauſed ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men to depart in all diligence to puniſh the Rebels of <hi>Tanadarus,</hi> who in ſuch ſort had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed thoſe in the Caſtle whom they had ſurpriz'd; as had it not been for the ſuccour which the King of <hi>Maldives</hi> ſent them, they had been already reduced to extremity, for want of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56329:117"/>having provided what was neceſſary to ſuſtain a Siege, and were even ready to ask mercy. But, when they diſcover'd the Ships which brought them aid, they recovered new forces, and ſet up, on their walls, the King of <hi>Maldives</hi> arms and Standards, to ſhew, that they gave themſelves to him, and acknowledg'd him their Prince.</p>
               <p>He that commanded that Fleet, was a Turk, renowned for his valour, and called <hi>Ibraim,</hi> who to get glory in that occaſion, and to witneſſe his paſſion to ſerve very well his religion, and new Maſter, (to whom he had given himſelf,) caus'd all his Troops to land in the fury of the tide at a place of the Iſland where they were not expected, very neer to <hi>Tanadarus;</hi> Although the approach were difficult enough, he boldly freed the paſſage, wherein ſome of his people were drowned, and came with eight thouſand men well arm'd with purpoſe to raiſe the Siege; which ſucceeded to him, to our prejudice; for our men were fain to expect him in open field, and give him Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, where he was ſo happy, as to remain Victor; he preſently caſt into that place, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, the Victuals, and Ammunitions, he had brought in his Ship<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and ſo refreſhed the beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in a whole years ſpace they could not be taken by famine.</p>
               <p>Being made proud with this victory, he ſorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf in the City, expecting a ſecond fleet, which arived, greater than the firſt: in ſo much, as this ill news comming to us, the King was conſtrain'd to ſend <hi>Arbiran</hi> with new troops, who would have me accompany him in that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56329:117"/>and ſhare in the glory, which he hop'd for, with him. Before my departure, I went to take leave of the King, who ſhewed me already a great deal of friendſhip, and ſeeing with what cheerfulneſs, I undertook that voyage, ſaid alond, that he had conceived great hopes of me, which ſo inflam'd my Courage, as I fear'd, it would not finde enough to be imployed on. When I had received his commands, I went to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe ſide, before whom, upon my Knee, I ſaid, Madam, being oblig'd to give you an account of all my actions, as your Knight, I am come to crave your leave, that I may ſerve the King your Father, at <hi>Tanadarus,</hi> under the valiant <hi>Arbiran,</hi> and there endeavor to do ſomething, which may make me worthy of the honor I have received from your Royall hands, and that you may be leſſe ſorry for the extraordinary favor you have done me. My Knight anſwered ſhe, with ſomewhat more confidence, than ordinary, I ſhallnever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the doing of a juſt action, and whereto I have been invited by his command, who hath all power upon me, and who cannot ſufficiently recompence the affection, which you have had, to his ſervice; Continue in well doing, and I am confident, you ſhall hereafter reap other fruits of his love; He may Madam, reply'd I, make me as great as he pleaſe, but though he ſhould divide his very Crown with me, and give me equall power over his Subjects with himſelf, do you think, I ſhould hold me more obliged to him for that favor, than for that he hath already done me, in conſenting to the great honor I
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56329:118"/>have received from you? Since you have made me what I am, and that I have the glorious, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, of being called after the greateſt beauty of the world; aſſure your ſelf, great Princeſſe, that I will cauſe diſcourſe of me henceforward, and if death prevent not my ambition, the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name you have beſtowed on me, ſhall travel far beyond the limits of this Kingdom. I had engaged my ſelf much farther in my Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if I had not conſidered, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready exceeded the bounds of reſpect, which a ſubject ought his Princeſſe, wherefore thinking it enough what I had ſaid, and inclining my ſelf very low to kiſſe the hem of her garment, ſhe did me the honor to offer me her hand, which cauſed me to return, full of ardent deſire of glory to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biran,</hi> whom I found ready to depart, and whom, with open ſigns of joy I followed.</p>
               <p>I then entred the eighteenth year of my age, and was grown to ſuch a ſtrength and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtature, that I could deſie the ſtrongeſt, at wraſtling, and had ſo well beſtowed my time with <hi>Arbiran,</hi> after I had left being Page, as that my skill was more commended, than my ſtrength. Beſides, <hi>Liſimena</hi> had ſo many charmes, and all her features ſo well form'd, that ſhe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſht all men with her beauty, which I dare not embolden my ſelf to deſcribe, leſt I may not be able to do it ſufficiently: The ambition I had to do ſomething, that might come to her ears, was ſo ſharp a ſpur unto me, as being at hand blows with our enemies, whom we went to force, even in their own Trenches, my good fortune would,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56329:118"/>that I had to do with their Chief, the valiant <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braim,</hi> who till that time, had ſo fortunately gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo great an enterprize. Him then I choſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, finding him doubly notable, as well for his aſpect, as horrible ſlaughter he made among our people; and after having ſome ſpace reſiſted the fury of his arm, in the end made him ſink by a blow of my ſword.

                  <hi>Arbiran</hi> on his ſide, had done his part ſo well, being aſſiſted by divers Gentlemen voluntiers, who did indeed wonders in that occaſion, that he put the reſt of our enemies to flight; and when he ſaw me return, cover'd with blood, and ſweat and duſt, with the reſtimony of what I had been ſeen to do, and how I had with my own hand ſlain the chief of the <hi>Maldives;</hi> he gave me great commendation, and did me the honor to write more good of me to the King than he had ſeen: I confesse to you Sir, that little action gave me great eſtimation, and from that inſtant I was thought fit to command a choſen Company of Souldiers, who had loft their chief in that Battel, and which I afterward led on many hot occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as we had routed the enemies Army,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56329:119"/>we had order from the King to return to the ſiege of <hi>Tanadarus,</hi> and to take that place whatſoever it coſt. But I abuſe your patience by telling you particulars of thoſe things, whereof all <hi>Aſia</hi> is inſorm'd, and which your ſelf ſhould know as well as thoſe who did them.

               <p>After we had taken that City, whoſe Siege laſted ten whole months, and that we had forc'd it at our enemies noſe, who were come with the unprofitable power of an hundred other ſails, to ſuccour it, the King gave me the government thereof: Notwithſtanding I reſted not long there, becauſe I was thought uſeful elſewhere, and that the brave <hi>Arbiran,</hi> who was Admiral of <hi>Zeylan,</hi> did me the honor to make me his Lieutenant to repel that Enemies Fleet, which ſince the taking of <hi>Tanadarus,</hi> had never ceaſed pillaging our ſhips returning from <hi>Narſinga,</hi> and ranſacking whatſoever call'd it ſelf ours.

The next morning, when we thought to recompence the Fight, there roſe ſo furious a tempeſt, the winde at Southweſt, as ſpoil'd our whole deſigns, and whether we would or no, were conſtrain'd to yield to the violence of the ſtorme, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd a part of our Fleet, and drave the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wherein we were, into the Road of <hi>Commory,</hi> at the point of <hi>Narſigna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The valiant <hi>Arbiran,</hi> impatient that he could not revenge as yet the injuries which thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous <hi>Maldives</hi> had ſo many times done us, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the King, that he might land upon one of their Iſlands, to endammage them to purpoſe, and do them the affront, with which they had but threatned us. The King having approved this deſign, we were eight months on ſitting our ſelves, that we might not fail of our purpoſe; during which time, I remained at the Court, and favored by the ſight, and entertainment of my divine Princeſſe, who touched with that little reputation, which I had gotten in thoſe laſt ſtirs, did ſo much the rather force her inclination to endure me, that ſhe look'd reſpectfully on me, and becauſe ſhe thought, that age which had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd me more knowledge, had diverted me from that diſordered meaning, which I had in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56329:120"/>my infancy, to ſerve her as a Lover. But alas, that liberty ſhe gave me, was the cauſe of all my ruin, for as it is the cuſtom of Lovers to flatter themſelves in their paſſions, I made my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the good acceptation ſhe began to give me, was a teſtimony of her affection, and ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my ſelf in my love, as I took her civility for an argument of good liking. Being deceived with this fooliſh belief, I proceeded farther, than before, even to embrace her with mine eyes, and to give her certain proofs by all my actions, that my flame was augmented. This obliged her to reſume her former ſeverity, and to live ſo recluſe unto me, that I am forc'd to ſay to my conſuſion, that ſince that day, ſhe never ſaw me but with trouble; Ny I was ſo unhappy, that fearing leſt I would take leave of her, the day of my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe ſaid ſhe was ſick, and kept herſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen by any.</p>
               <p>I loſt not however my courage, although the better part of my amorous hopes; and followed <hi>Arbiran</hi> as reſolutely, as if I had departed with a favor from <hi>Liſimena,</hi> ſo powerful in my ſoul, was the defire of glory, where ambition reign'd with Love. Our deſign ſucceeded happily, we forc'd the place we attempted, which was the moſt important of all <hi>Atollon</hi> in the Province of <hi>Padipol:</hi> but the poor <hi>Arbiran</hi> was ſlain, when he had don a thouſand memorable exploits of valour. This our irreparable loſſe, was ſo felt by all the Army, and in ſuch ſort troubled it, not knowing where to go for counſel, and not daring yet to truſt its conduct to my youth, although I
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56329:120"/>were Lieutenant to the Admiral, that we retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without doing any thing, and without ſo much as leaving a Gariſon in the place we had taken.</p>
               <p>I bare with great impatience (truly) the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of that loſſe, and at my return, I had the honor to be comforted by the Kings own mouth, who better than any other, knew the cauſe I had to be afflicted. But alas, it was not from him I look'd for the healthful remedies of my ſenſible griefs, one only word from <hi>Liſimenaes</hi> mouth, had comforted me not only for the loſſe of my friend, but alſo of my heart, in ſerving her, and of all the troubles I endured for her. But I was very far from the hope of that favor, ſhe ſhun'd me more than before, and her ſcorns, which I could not endure, by little and little choack'd the reſpect which remained for her in my ſoul. As though nature had made me ſenſible of what I was, I thought in my ſelf, that I deſerved a milder uſage, and if not as a Lover, yet in the quality of <hi>Liſimenaes</hi> Knight I deſerv'd, a freer acceſſe unto her than ſhe gave me. I could not conceal my diſpleaſure, but gave my paſſion ſo much conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as it came to the Kings cars, as I have ſince known, who feigned to know nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was ſo neceſſary for his ſervice; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he feared leſt that affection might take too deep root in my heart, and beſides the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance which I might ſhew to all the Court, I might do him ill ſervice, and make my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to command his Armies, if I ſhould loſe the Maſtery of my ſelf. He therefore removed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56329:121"/>from my ſight that divine object, upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, favorable enough to his diſtruſt; for as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Arbirans</hi> death I had very ill handled the <hi>Maldives</hi> in two, or three rancounters, who were put to ſea, to repair their loſſes, and former out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager, they reſolved to make one final attempt, and having ſhut up all their Ports, leſt news might be brought us of their deſign, they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a great and mighty Fleet to powre on us; but they could not work ſo privately, but that a Spie came to advertiſe us, of their enterpriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Judge Sir, by what I have told you of my Love, if this ſeperation muſt be grievous to me; however, I muſt bear it, and conſtrain my ſelf in the Kings ſight, who obſerv'd me more than he was wont, to ſee if my ſpirit were chang'd, or whether I had rigor enough to digeſt that trouble without diſtraction. I was indeed, very happy in my conſtancy, to reſiſt my reſentment in that occaſion, where it may be, any other,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56329:121"/>than my ſelf might have ſuffered himſelf to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome; for the King who had a very good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of my courage, believing I had quire for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that paſſion, which kindled in my heart by <hi>Liſtmenaes</hi> preſence only, did me the honor, with the general conſent of the whole Army, to make me heir of all <hi>Arbirans</hi> command.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I found the whole force of the Kingdom in my hands, a new deſire of glory en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred my heart, and ſeeing that our enemies were ſlow in comming to us, and that they could not be a long time ready, I perſwaded the King to give way that I might go and aſſault them in the Iſle of <hi>Bandos,</hi> neer the City of <hi>Male,</hi> where I had intelligence.

               <p>During the time of the Ball, without thinking of any thing ſave being merry, as indeed there was no reaſon to ſuſpect an evil, the King was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed to ſee the wiſe <hi>Almerin,</hi> Prince <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> faithful Squire comming towards him, out of breath, who at firſt throwing himſelf as his feet, Sir, if you make not haſte to ſuccour your ſon ſpeedily, he will run the hazard of dying the moſt tragical death that ever was.

               <p>This news, did no leſſe trouble the Company, than that which <hi>Pirobus</hi> had brought but lately had contented them; and that a preſent remedy might be given to that inconvenience, the King in great trouble, commanded <hi>Almerin,</hi> to tell him what new misfortune had befallen his Son, and what courſe might be taken to ſave his Life.</p>
               <p>Know (Sir, ſaid the Paſt, who had ſcarce the leiſure given him to draw his breath) that

               <p>I doubt not but you have heard, how the Princeſſ: <hi>Orazia,</hi> immediatly after that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py combat, thought fit to ſpread a noyſe, that my Maſter was dead, that the King her Father incenſed againſt him, as much as is poſſible, night have the leſſe reaſon to ſend after him; The report of his death laſted for ſome dayes: but being impoſſible to keep any thing very ſecret in the Court, <hi>Saradin,</hi> who till that time had been very wiſe, could not chuſe but reveal it at length unto a very intimate friend of his call'd <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> from whom he hid very few things, and told him for truth, that our Princes (but told him not, that they were ſo) were hid in his houſe, on the way to <hi>Baticalus,</hi> where the King had layn without knowing it. This <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> was in favour with a Lady of the Court, called <hi>Corisba,</hi> who was that <hi>Lerians</hi> Siſter, whom <hi>anaxander</hi> had ſlain in Duell, at his firſt comming to the Court of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> being provoked by him, through his jealouſie, that the Prince <hi>Arontus</hi> favoured him too much; and as it is the Cuſtom of Lovers, to conceal nothing from their Miſtreſſes, <hi>Floreſtan</hi> was ſo unworthy, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56329:130"/>his friends ſecret, unto his. This wicked woman finding a fair way to be revenged on him, who had ſlain her Brother, goes boldly to the King, tells him where our Maſters were, and that at hazard of her life, he ſhould finde them alive in <hi>Saradins</hi> Caſtle, where they laught at his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and skorn'd the rigor of his laws.</p>
               <p>The King, who had been offended, and who kept his anger ſtill in force, found it renew within him, by this unhappy notice; he by and by commanded an Officer to ſeize on <hi>Saradin,</hi> and to be anſwerable for him untill he had ſeen whether it were true which <hi>Corisba</hi> had told him, and to be throughly ſatisfied, he diſpacht the Provoſt of <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> with a great many of the guard, to bring our Princes to him, either alive or dead, that however they came, they might ſerve as a memorable example to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of his deſpis'd authority. <hi>Saradin,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently found himſelf guilty of his little <hi>ſecreſie,</hi> ſound means to advertiſe the Princeſſe <hi>Orazia</hi> of this diſorder, that ſhe might ſeek to remedy it, and accuſed himſelf of having revealed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to one, whom he accounted as his other ſelf, not remembring that he kept his ſiſter, whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxander</hi> had ſlain.

               <p>Admire the extravagancy of Fare, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Fortune, we were ready the very next day to be gone from that place, the Prince my Maſter was perfectly well of his hurts, and we were in the pleaſure of our approaching journey, when this meſſenger came to us: At firſt without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, he preſſed us to be gone, becauſe he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd us, that thoſe who ſought our lives were not far from us. <hi>Anaxander</hi> had ſcarce read the Princeſſes letter to <hi>Piroxenus</hi> and me, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Caſtle beleagured with that rabble of Archers which in number were above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,

Meanwhile, the reſt kept loudly beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the great gate of the baſe Court, ſaying that they came from the King, and that we muſt follow them. When we had diſpatch'd the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt, we conſulted what we had to do: and on the other ſide, thoſe roagues, having heard the claſhing of our ſwords, incenſed by our reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, threatned to burn us if we came not forth, and yield our ſelves to them. The generous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxander</hi> ſeeing us reduc'd to that extremity, he who never feared in danger, nor never drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the greateſt threats of fortune, ſeeing we were to weak to reſiſt that multitude of armed men, and that as it would be weakneſſe in us to ſuffer our deſtruction, without reſiſtance, ſo it would be raſhneſſe to ſet upon them, with ſo ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as we were; He directed the little gate to be opened again, whereby they could not enter but two and two, which paſſage, we three would well enough maintain; and, ſhould they be ſo
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56329:131"/>unwiſe as to hazard themſelves, we might kill a good many of them, and by ſo many, leſſen the number of our enemies. His opinion was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put in execution; but when the firſt five or ſix came ſhort, the reſt retired; inſomuch, as we ſhut the gate again, to ſee what the gods would counſel us; and truly in that eminent danger I was very ſorry for <hi>Neanders</hi> abſence, whom <hi>Piroxenus</hi> had ſent to <hi>Orixa,</hi> for being a man skilful and valiant, he would by one means or another have been very helpful to us.</p>
               <p>We were by this time weary of ſlaughter, where we had ſo good fortune, as but one of ours were ſlain, and of us three <hi>Anaxander</hi> only had a light hurt in his ſhoulder; but indeed, the Princes behaved themſelves ſo couragiouſly, that if they had had to do but with a ſcore of them, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they would have made no more reſiſtance to their fury than the former did.</p>
               <p>The Provoſt diſcerning that by force he could not ſo ſoon poſſeſs himſelf of us, in that Caſile, by the advice of his companions, aſſembled the Peaſants of the next Village, who being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bring with them, ſtore of ſtraw, and dry fagots, they ſet fire to the gate of the baſe Court, and Stables belonging to the Caſtle, with intention to burn it, or compel us to come forth; when we perceived the fire to encreaſe towards us, we thought it better became us, to diſput<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56329:132"/>to try to ſave, than to defend themſelves; there being no Lance for me, I took my ſword in my hand, and our people opening the gate as the Princes commanded them, which was already half conſumed, we ſet ſpurs lively to our horſes, and paſt through the flame, which was more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable unto us than thoſe that looked for us <hi>Anaxander</hi> who was beſt mounted would paſſe firſt, and flying like lightning, ran three or four of them through with his Lance, which in one body waited for us in the paſſage, and gave leave to <hi>Piroxenus</hi> and me to ſave our ſelves, but as our unhappy Prince thought himſelf free from thoſe hangmens hands, ill fortune would that his horſe aſtoniſh'd at the flame, which hurt his eyes in paſſing, fell with him in a ditch very neer his enemies: they inſtantly fell upon him, and being under his horſe, we ſaw without being able to help him, how they took away his Lance and ſword, and bound him with cords, as ſoon as they had diſarm'd him.</p>

               <p>Here <hi>Almerin</hi> ended his diſcourſe, which did not ſo much trouble the King, but that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſome hope for him: for knowing <hi>Orazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> love, he believed that fair Princeſſe would not fail to uſe all her credit, and power for him whom ſhe was to marry: Beſider, <hi>Paroxeaus</hi> his eſcape was another ſign of comfort, perſuming that he would finde friends in the Court to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the King not to precipitate his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſhould declare himſelf ſo great a Prince, untill the truth were known; In the meanwhile not to loſe time, he ſent <hi>Falantus</hi> his Gentleman of the horſe in all ſpeed with ſuch a direction as he inſtantly conceiv'd.</p>

               <p>The King would added threats to the end of his letter, in caſe that ſome misfortune might have befallen poor <hi>Anaxander</hi> ere the comming of theſe, but he was diſſwaded by his counſel, who were of opinion, that in caſe nothing had yet hapned to the Princes diſadvantage, threats might incenſe the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> and ſet him upon extremities, which his own inclinations might not move him to; wherefore they thought it ſufficient, to have a great Army in readyneſſe, which <hi>Liſimantus</hi> ſhould command, and ſhould march great journeys, and be ready to powre on <hi>Narfinga,</hi> and revenge an affront which they yet but feared.</p>

Like thoſe, who have run great hazards at ſea, and endure nothing with ſo great impatience, as ſhipwrack, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the Haven: That poor Princeſſe unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, who had ſo much already lamented her ſons death, and been battered by ſo many ſtorms, and croſſes paſt, was never ſo ſenſible, as of this laſt torment, which aſſaulted her juſt when ſhe thought her ſelf under the ſhelter of all manner of afflictions, and misfortunes; ſhe had already
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56329:134"/>flattered her ſelf with ſweet hope of embracing her ſon, ſhe had invited the whole Court to honor his wellcome, ſhe imagined that the tenderneſs of a mothers love, would not afford embraces e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to cheriſh ſo vertuous a child, when that ſad meſſenger came and ſpoil'd her at an inſtant of thoſe ſweet meditations, to ſet her ſpirit on the rack, ſcarce pacifi'd with ſome ſmall intervals of falſe joy.</p>
               <p>The King would willingly have ſeconded her in her juſt ſorrow, and found matter of comfore for her, as he was wont, but the poor Prince had other things to think on; for though in ſome ſort he expected that the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> would not proceed ſo faſt; that point was too tickliſh, to leave him without great cauſe of doubt, and he was wiſe enough to foreſee, that to ground any hope upon the uncertain judgement of men, was but to build upon a moving ſand.</p>
               <p>He therefore cauſed <hi>Liſimantus</hi> at the head of a hundred thouſand men, to depart a few daies after <hi>Falantus</hi> had his diſpatch. That young Knight was full of ſpirit, and exceedingly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to his Maſters ſervice; and ſeeing that his Princes ſafety, and the States quiet depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his diligence, he got upon the beſt and ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt horſe in the <hi>Indes,</hi> and reſolv'd to take him at far as his heart, and legs would carry him, before he would take Poſt: But, whiles he does his beſt, to come in good time to <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> let us make more haſte there than he, and ſee what is done againſt <hi>Anaxander.</hi>

               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:56329:134"/>
               <p>After that unfortunate Prince had been very hardly uſed on the way, by thoſe men without pitty, w hoſe number he had ſo couragiouſly, and in vain diminiſhed, he was conducted into that ſad place, where once he expected to receive a more gentle entertainment; <hi>Piroxonus,</hi> who was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd but one day before him, had reaped no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit of his diligence, than lading the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Orazia's</hi> ſpirit with affliction and ſorrow, by recounting to her how <hi>Anaxander</hi> was taken, and preſſing her to uſe all the means ſhe could or his ſafety; but the poor Lady knew not to whom to adreſſe her ſelf, and however violent paſſion ſhe had to ſave her dear husband, her ſhame too much withheld her from declaring it to the King, whom ſhe her ſelf dared not to ſpeak to, nor knew ſhe whom elſe to truſt, or chuſe to do it in her ſtead.</p>
               <p>That which caus'd the misfortune and the ruin of our Princes, was their having lived with too much ſplendor and authority, during <hi>Arontus</hi> life, when they had held ſuch rank, and kept ſuch ſtate, among the Courtiers of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> as they had got more jealouſie, than friendſhip; One only, <hi>Saradin,</hi> had been able to have helped them, in that extremity, and ſeconded the Princeſſe good endeavour, if himſelf, for his innocent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, had not partaken with them.</p>
               <p>When the King came to know, that he was guilty of concealing the breakers of his Edict, he commanded him to be carried from his houſe where he was detayned, to the ſame priſon where the unhappy <hi>Anaxander</hi> was ſhut up. All that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56329:135"/>
                  <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> with the Princeſſe, could do, was, to ſcatter a murmur through the Court, that he, whom they had uſed with ſo great in humanity, was the Prince <hi>Anaxander, Alcidaris</hi> the King of <hi>Cambayas</hi> Son, but very few were found that believed it, and the King himſelf who heard thereof, laught at it; becauſe he had long time believed the common report, that he, with <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxenus,</hi> was ſlain, together with the two Princes of <hi>Decan,</hi> in that ſally they made, during the ſiege of <hi>Viſaporus,</hi> beſides the aſſurance they had lately received from <hi>Pirobus</hi> his mouth, that the King of <hi>Cambaya</hi> had but one Son alive. That had not retarded his condemnation one minute, had there not hapned a conteſtation between the Miniſters of Juſtice: The Grand Provoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he ought to give Judgement on him, becauſe he had taken, and brought him by the Kings command; and on totheer ſide, becauſe he had commanded in Armies, and till that time, done things, becomming a Gentleman, and a man of quality, The Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Naires</hi> diſputed, that it belonged to him to make his proceſſe, and ſpent two or three dayes in this debate, the one undoing, and diſanulling, what the other commanded, inſomuch, as the King was fain himſelf to regulate it. He was, then, of opinion, that ſeeing there had been certain of the guard ſlain by <hi>Ariomant,</hi> there was no reaſon, that their Chief ſhould be both Judge and Party, and that it was reaſonable that the Court of <hi>Nayres</hi> knew that it was a very eaſie matter to proceed againſt a man convicted, and that they
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56329:135"/>ſhould haſten his Judgement, that he might quickly ſerve for an example.</p>
               <p>The Princeſſe had ſome ſmall hope, that the King her Father would not ſo wholly yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to his paſſions, but that he would caſt an eye to the many ſervices which her <hi>Anaxander</hi> had formerly done the dead Prince <hi>Arontus,</hi> as well as the Crown, under the name of <hi>Ariomant:</hi> beſides, ſhe hoped for ſome good, from the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <hi>Almerin</hi> had made into <hi>Cambaya:</hi> but when ſhe ſaw that the King haſtned ſo very much the Judgement of the cauſe; and that purpoſely for that reaſon, he had ſent to the Chief of the Judges; ſhe thought he would run great haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and that when it may be her Fathers nature might incline to Pitty and Compaſſion, he ight be too much engaged to this honour, and his word, not to give ſuch example to his people.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of hte Judges, were very ſorry for that poor offenders misfortune, and ſeeing when they came to give Judgement, that there was no liklihood of ſaving him, there was not one, but did it againſt his will, and with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row condemned a man of ſo great merit; but the reverence of the Laws, and the honour they bare unto the Princes authority, oblig'd them, rather to ſave his Oaths, than him who had deſpis'd them; and ſeeing they muſt do Juſtice, they pronounced the ſentencce of death againſt <hi>Anaxander,</hi> and condemned him, to have his Head ſtruck off, in the great place before the Palace.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:56329:136"/>
               <p>When this ſad ſentence was read unto him in the Priſon, he was marvelouſly ſurpris'd; for beſide, that he hoped for deliverance, by <hi>Pirex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus,</hi> and <hi>Almerin,</hi> and from the Princeſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, he did not expect that the ſeverity of the Laws would have extended to that laſt rigor, and thought, when they had only frighted him with puniſhment, they would have let him go. But when he ſaw it was in good earneſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him to death: Friend, ſayd he, to him that came as Deputy from the Court of <hi>Nayres,</hi> does the King know who I am, and that he hath no power of right over my life?</p>
               <p>Sir, Anſwered the Judge, there hath been a report ſpred here, that you are the King of <hi>Cambayas</hi> Son; but the King will not believe it, and himſelf told us, he had a thouſand arguments to convince that falſehood; he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is this the welcome that Strangers receive in this country, which come to do is honour? although I were not as I am, born a Prince, yet ought my perſon to be ſafe even
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:56329:136"/>by the Law of Nations; your Laws cannot by right extend themſelves beyond the limits of this Kingdom, nor puniſh crimes of honour, in thoſe, whom you have not forbidden, and are not ſubject to the obſervation of your Lawes. Muſt I ſerve as an example, and be the firſt man chaſtis'd for an action, never yet by any man ſeen puniſh'd in <hi>Narſinga,</hi> though Ducls frequent in it, and Edicts chang'd a thouſand times? Ah, pray bid the King he look more than once to what he does, and that a Kings Son ought not to be the firſt mark of his vengeance. Go to him preſently, if you love his honour, and ask the Princeſſe, whether in diſgrace ſhe will abandon thoſe, whom in Proſperity ſhe hath made ſhew to love.</p>
               <p>The Judge was much aſtoniſhed at his words, and thought himſelf oblig'd to tell them the King, wherefore he came knocking to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door, to acquaint him, w ith what he had learnt from <hi>Ariomant;</hi> but the Door keeper would not admit him, becauſe the King was private with his Daughter, and had forbidden any whaſoever, to be let in, till ſhe were gone.</p>
               <p>That amorous Princeſſe, having known of <hi>Anaxanders</hi> condemnation, and ſeeing that all her vain hopes of his liberty, promiſed no good, overcome by her ſorrow, and moſt earneſtly importun'd by Love, forgot all reſpect, and ſhame; and believing, that that very day, he, whom ſhe ſo tenderly loved, ſhould unhappily end his dayes, and be a ſhamefull ſpectacle for
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56329:137"/>all the Court, jealous of his Vertues, and paſt Victories, went and caſt her ſelf at the King her Fathers feet, and full of tears, told him the reaſon ſhe had, to beg <hi>Anaxanders</hi> life of him, whom ſhe boldly avowed for her Husband, and with a thouſand oaths, and by the teſtimony of her dead brother <hi>Arontus,</hi> ſhe confirm'd the noyſe that went of his illuſtrious extraction.</p>
               <p>The King was ſo moved, and troubled in his mind at thoſe words, as he was a ſufficient ſpace without replying any thing: at length, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with extream ſeverity upon the Princeſſe: Unhappy Woman, ſaid he, is it poſſible thou wouldſt endure thy ſelf to be overtaken by this ſtrangers prating, ſo mſerable an unknown man, who is come ſo far to laugh at my lawes, to violate my Edicts, and happily thy ſelf alſo; ſay, quickly, hath he ſtayn'd thy bed, and my race, and whether ſurpriz'd with his embraces, after thou went taken with his lies, thou gaveſt thy ſelf up to his lewd deſires.</p>
               <p>The Princeſſ: exceedingly amazed to finde ſo harſh a uſage from him, who had never been but very kinde to her, recollected yet, all her reaſon, and ſtrength, not to ſeem troubled in her anſwer, and to try to perſwade her Father, in her Lovers behalf.</p>
               <p>How Sir, ſaid ſhe, to him, could you have ſo ill an opinion of your Daughter as to think her able to commit ſo foul an Action? May not a man be valued without giving ones ſelf up to him? and do you think me ſo filly, and light, to give Prince <hi>Anaxander</hi> the hearing, without
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56329:137"/>firſt aſſurances of his birth, as well by my dead Brother, as by his own confeſſion: when in my Couſin <hi>Liſimenaes</hi> hearing, he made me an ample relation of all his adventures. Believe me Sir, if I have avowed him my affection, I have done it with all Modeſty, becomming my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and my Sex, and being aſſured you never would diſlike the ſure of ſo vertuous a Prince: for my ſake only he ſtole from his Parents, run great hazard in forein parts, and would not diſcover himſelf to you, but in a Princes equipage, which he was about to do, when you ſurpriz'd him with your guard.</p>
               <p>The King, whom rage had fully poſſeſſed, and made incapable of the Princeſſe reaſons: O ſilly Maid, ſaid he, how haſt then been ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous to his perſwaſions, whoſe errand here, was only to abuſe thee? Where canſt thou ſinde me other proofs of his birth, than from his own mouth? he had, (ſayſt thou) perſwaded thy Brother, as fooliſh as thy ſelf, and ſome ground he muſt needs ſeek to build his treaſon on, and ſurprize thee.

But to let thee ſee, he is a meer deceiver, and that <hi>Anaxander</hi> is really dead, didſt not thou lately ſee, that <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robus</hi> confirm'd it, being ſent Embaſſador to me from the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and aſſur'd me, he
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56329:138"/>had only <hi>Alcidaris</hi> left of the two Children the gods had given him? Thinkeſt thou that if <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> had not been ſlain in that ſally, with <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> and the two Princes of <hi>Decan,</hi> the King his Father who lamented him infinitely, and made all poſſible means to over-take him, would not have learn'd it by ſome of his ſervants, and that no man would be ſo charitable, as to raiſe the Queen <hi>Anaxarette</hi> from the deep melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly wherein her dear ſons loſſe had for ever caſt her?

               <p>The poor Princeſſe had not courage to reply unto the ſharpneſſe of that laſt language, but full of confuſion withdrew herſelf, conſidering the tragical deſigns, and her mind feeding on nothing but deadly thoughts: How ſaid ſhe, in her ſelf, can I endure without reſentment, that a Tyran: father, handle ſo unworthily, the deareſt thing I love in the world? ſhall I not have ſo much credit as to ſave the one half of my ſoul, which a moſt cruel man will take from me?

               <p>With this bloody reſolution, ſhe retir'd into her Chamber, and driving from her as many as would divert her from her deadly ſorrow, ſhe cauſed a little Page whom ſhe loved, to be call'd to her, and with a ſeeming ſetled underſtanding, and a countenance, which witneſſed nothing leſſe, than what was in her thoughts, bid him go buy a fine Dagger which ſhe would give him, to wear with that little ſword by his ſide, but that he ſhould beware of letting her women know it, becauſe they would be jealous of the love ſhe bare him. This child, who was far from gueſſing at the Tragical deſign of his Miſtreſſe, did preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he was commanded; and with the money ſhe gave him, bought a prety little Poinard, which he came and delivered her.

               <p>While ſhe remaind in this deadly trouble, and bloody diſpleaſure, lets ſee what <hi>Piroxenus</hi> did on his ſide; when he heard publickly, that there was no more hope for his friend; and that the Judge who pronounced the ſentence of death upon him, had been in vain perſwading the King, that he ſhould do well to delay the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, untill the truth of what the offender ſaid concerning his extraction, were known.

               <p>But let us leave theſe needleſſe digreſſions, to acquit our ſelves of our promiſe, in making all the world ſee the incomparable ſorrow of that incomparable friend, that faithful <hi>Piroxenus,</hi> who till that time conceal'd himſelf (as guilty as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxander,</hi>) to ſee if he could finde any means to ſuccour him. When he perceiv'd that he had no more to hope, he thought he had no more to fear, and ſeeing that they were about to carry his other ſelf to execution, his dear and faithful friend, for whom in times paſt, during <hi>Orixa's</hi> misfortune, he had been forc'd to live, he was not long to reſolve whether he ought to die with him or no.</p>
               <p>When he knew, that he was taken out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to be conducted to his end, environed with two companies of the Kings guard, he drew his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56329:140"/>ſword to run himſelf through, but recalling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inſtantly from that precipirate actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: My deer <hi>Anaxander,</hi> ſaid he, I may not in this manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee, ſince having lived ſo well, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, thou art ready to die in favour with the gods, and that I ſee already, heaven open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee, I ſhould never meet they happy ſoul, if I ſhould commit this outrage on my ſelf, and move the gods by this ſo contrary action to the laws of Nature. For thy ſake then I will not die by my own hands, becauſe our ſouls may meet again; but I will force that rabble which encompaſſe thee, to give me the ſtroak of death; Ile throw my ſelf among them, and the gods ſhall bear me witneſſe, that I advance not my daies, by an unworthineſſes of heart, which makes me ſinck under under the burden of my ſorrows. I know it is the part of a couragious man, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with conſtancy the croſſes of Fortune; that to ſtand up againſt her, is to ſcorn her, and to endure her evils patiently, is to deride her; But my dear Couſin, I am nto able I confeſſe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for thy ſake, what I could for my own: be it how it will, I mean to follow thee, and ſhould curſe my life, a thouſand times, if I ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to out-live thee a minute.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaying, in great fury he came forth of his houſe, and without farther care of being known in the ſtreets, went ſtrait to the place, where the poor <hi>Anaxander</hi> was bound upon the Scaffold, paler through anger, than through fear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute to die, in that diſability to defend himſelf from the outrage they committed on his innocency.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56329:140"/>When <hi>Piroxenus</hi> ſaw him in that pittiful condition, he grew doubly incenſed, and in that paſſion of rage which blinded him, reſolv'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his own, and his friends death, on thoſe who were not guilty of it; and in ſpite of thoſe that guarded the place, who were ranged like a hedg and environed the Scaffold, to make way with his two ſwords unto it, that he might once more ſay farewell to him he lov'd a thouſand times more than himſelf.</p>
               <p>The two Bracmanes, who attended <hi>Anaxan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> had already begun the laſt prayers for his ſoul, all the company anſwered the ſad time which they prayed in, and the Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thoſe Souldiers who ſuſpected nothing, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56329:141"/>were far from fearing any attempt for <hi>Anaxan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> deliverance, were wonderfully amazed, and aſtoniſhed, that the boldneſſe of one man procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that extream temerity, by and by, by their Captains command, who blaſphem'd for anger, they encompaſſed the Scaffold, which wae raiſed ſome ten ſteps, and could not be come to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Ladder; but as many as offred to come up were hewn in pieces, and thoſe two Lions, who look'd for nothing leſſe, than ſaving themſelves, did wonderful effects, to ſell their lives, and well diſpute them.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Anaxander</hi> ſaw that they recoiled, and dared no longer approach them: Friends, ſaid he to them, the gods are my witneſſes that with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row I ſpill your blood, remember when I led you in War, and how, (it may be,) I help'd you very well to ſet the Crown on his head, who now would take away my life for an action of honor, whereto beſide, I was provoked by <hi>Liſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus</hi> fault. Since my ruin is inevitable, he ſhall ſhortly ſee, what tis tomeddle with the ſone of Kings his neighboure, who give not place to him for power.</p>
               <p>Friends, ſaid <hi>Piroxenus</hi> to the people, on the other ſide, if ye knew the miſchief which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth you in our loſſe, ye would all take arms to ſave us from the fury of a Tyrant, whom we have delivered from the oppreſſion of two ſlaves, who were greedy after your goods and lives. Know, that however you ſee us, we are two mighty Princes, left to the ſeverity of Fortune, and if the outrage unjuſtly begun, be finiſhed upon
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56329:141"/>us, ye ſhall all ſuffer, though ye be innocent, and very ſhortly ſee, all the King of <hi>Cambayas</hi> power fall upon you, and your children, who is my mothers brother, and that unhappy Princes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom I but now unlooſed from the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hands.</p>
               <p>Theſe diſcourſes aſſiſted by the graceſful action of thoſe two men of ſo excellent aſpect, began already to work ſome impreſſion in the peoples minds; there was not one civil man, who with horror beheld not the injuſtice done thoſe two brave courages, and who would not willingly have hazarded his life for their ſafety; but the ſequel was of too much fear, and the dread of the Kings anger reſtrained the moſt factious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: Meanwhile, the Souldiers by the Captains command were gone to ſetch Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to aſſault our Princes on every ſide, and try to take them alive, that by an ignominious death, the ſlaughter they had made on their companions might be revenged, forbidding any arrows to be ſhot at them, which had by ſome been done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; when from the Palace gate-ward, a great throng was ſeen to come, and the King himſelf before them, which began to cry on all ſides, grace: but the confuſed noiſe the Souldiees made about the Scaffold, hindred them from hearing that favorable cry; when the King who cauſed room to be made, by the Archers of his guard who went before him, was come neer, and had underſtood what <hi>Piroxenus</hi> had done, he wondered, and more again, when he ſaw the two Princes defend themſelves ſo couragiouſly againſt
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56329:142"/>an armed multitude. Hold, cry'd he out to the Souldiers, as ſoon as he could be heard: all that were before him did the like, in as much as at length, thoſe blood-thirſty men perceived the King neer them, and heard his countermands.</p>
               <p>His preſence then, having clamed the ſtorm, all held their peace, and bent their eyes upon him, to ſee what 'twas he would command them, and underſtand the reaſon of his comming perſonally there; when turning towards the Princes, who were not leſſe aſtoniſh'd at his comming, than the people, and directing his ſpeech to them, ſpake in this manner.</p>
               <p>I am ſo full of confuſion, Sirs, for what I very lately have underſtood, that whereas you think I am come to give you pardon, I come to ask it of you, and to conjure you likewiſe, to forgive me a crime, which I have ignorantly committed, and whereof my paſſion only, is guilty. See ſaid he to Prince <hi>Anaxander,</hi> if you know this young Kinight, Gentleman of the horſe to the King your father, tis he that hath unfolded me my errour, and who hath freed me from a misfortune, after which I never ſhould have been comforted, if the laſt act of the Tragedy had been performed on you.</p>

               <p>At theſe words the Princes redoubled their embraces of <hi>Falantus;</hi> and truly they had great reaſon ſo to do, as he who by his incredble dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence became their redeemer, having in four daies, and as many nights, rid more than two hundred leagnes, whereto, that excellent horſe very much contributed, which he took with him, whereon without ſtop, he diſpatched eight or nine Poſts; by this means he arrived at the time he ſhould, to ſave their lives ſo dear to the King his Maſter, and had he more delai'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he had in vain perform'd that jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; for the two generous Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They departed then from that place, to go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Temple; and in the meanwhile, the little <hi>Ariſton,</hi> who had ſeen all theſe paſſages, went before to advertiſe his Miſtreſſe, whom he found, laid on a little bed in her Cloſet, wholly over come with ſorrow, and already threatning her fair boſome, with the Dagger, from which ſhe hoped all her remedy.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ſhe ſaw the Page come in, ſhe roſe

No Madam, anſwer'd he, the King himſelf came and delivered him, and did him all manner of honor; there is ſome myſtery in the matter which I know not; for I underſtood by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed noiſe, which I heard from the middle of the place, that the offender was the King of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayaes</hi> ſon; he told her after, what <hi>Piroxenus</hi> had done, and the memorable exploits they both perform'd upon the Scaffold.</p>
               <p>The Princeſſe tranſported with that news, which ſhe well enough underſtood, could not forbear embracing the little <hi>Ariſton,</hi> and was a quarter of an hour and more in a kinde of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; truly he did well to come, and prepare her mind for that joy: for if at firſt it had come to her, from the Kings mouth, ſhe could never have forborne to have ſhewn her raviſhment, whereas, ſhe had the time to compoſe her ſelf, to receive that pleaſure without diſquiet, and to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny her countenance, with a modeſt coldneſſe, when her father came.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he had thank'd the gods, he entred the Princeſſe chamber, followed by <hi>Anaxander, piroxenus,</hi> and <hi>Falantus,</hi> who however well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for that viſit, had much to do to diſuiſe her contentment, and retain her joy; ſo long it was, that ſhe had not ſeen her dear <hi>Anaxander,</hi> as that only conſideration was enough to ſhake her reſolution, and her conſtancy, and diſcover openly to the King her father, the impatiency of her mind, and violence of her love: yet ſhe

               <p>At theſe words our lovers could no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their tranſports, they chang'd not only faiths, but kinde embraces, before all the company, and with mutual tears of joy which ran from their eyes, they dewed one another.

               <p>After his diſpatch to <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> and <hi>Orixa,</hi> he ſent back <hi>Falantus</hi> to <hi>Alcidaris,</hi> that he, better than any man, might expreſſe his own, and all his ſubjects joy, whereof that great monarch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to come, and ſhare in his own perſon; The Queen <hi>Anaxarette,</hi> not contented with the relations which would be made her of the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificences prepared for her ſons Wedding, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to accompany him in that journey.</p>
               <p>They then, fitted themſelves as ſoon as they could, and having left good Gariſons in their Countries, although in peace, they choſe out the moſt expert Cavalliers of their Court, and the handſomeſt women of <hi>Amadaba, Campanel,</hi> and <hi>Cambaye,</hi> to conduct them to that delightful

               <p>The King of <hi>Zeylan,</hi> having known hereof by a Poſt diſpatched to him by the King his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law, he would likewiſe carry with him his daughter, whom with a great deal of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had vowed to <hi>Liſimantus,</hi> whoſe birth he learnt from <hi>Albalot,</hi> whom <hi>Alcidaris</hi> had ſent him, and failed not to be waited on by all the beauty of his Iſland, that his Subjects might be ſeen to want, nor skill, nor power, and that they might compare with all other nations.

               <p>That City was exceeding great, and one of the moſt renowned of the Eaſt; but by reaſon of the great multitude, and innumerable affluence which came from all parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> to make ſome at the ſports prepared, and magnificencies, which invited every body to them, they were fain to ſet up Tents and Pavillions without the Walls, and mark out all the lodgings of the City, for the followers of thoſe three Kings, who came with the faireſt and the richeſt ornaments of their Courts.</p>

               <p>I will not repeat in order the wonders of the field, wherein were imployed all the ornaments of Architecture that could be found, nor of the Kings Scaffold, the Ladies, and the Judges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Jaſper, Marble, and Porphire, were the leaſt

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouzels, which are very amply deſcribed, in all the repreſentations of the Combats, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the magnificence of thoſe publique Feaſts; but I will mention only ſome of their Rules, which I found very pretty, as well in their Fencing Combats, which they more freqoently practiſe than the reſt of all <hi>India</hi> on this ſide <hi>Ganges,</hi> as in their fighting with Darts.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of Fencing in throng, are two manner of waies uſed among them ordinarily, by ſuch as defend or maintain Ambition, againſt thoſe that maintain Love; of theſe latter, there are two ſorts, the pleaſed, againſt the malcontents, and the malecontents againſt the deſpairers; No man comes into the place of Fence, ſave the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and their God-fathers, except ſuch as can proove that they have there gained five Victories formerly, and ſuch are ſet by the Judges ſide to aſſiſt them.</p>
               <p>The Combats of Darts are more myſterious; for a man can uſe no other than ſuch as are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Ladies. They take glory in obliging ſtrangers particularly, by the civility of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, in their houſes, and ſend them the faireſt they can deviſe, adorn'd with characters, and deviſes, and the Combatants tie them to their Girdles with great gold and ſilk Ribbans. The God-fathers, go and entreat the Combatants Miſtreſſer, that they may have their liking, to bear ſuch names as they have choſen, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56329:147"/>cauſe them to be written down, before the Judges of the Combat, who cannot exerciſe that office, untill they have been at the leaſt, ten times Conquerers; the Heralds of Arms are at the entrance of the field, to do their meſſages, clad in very rich coats of Arms, aſter the Indian manner; Before the Combat begins, becauſe the field is of a ſquare form, the four Heralds go to the four corners, to publiſh the Law, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Combat, which the Judges deliver them, whereof I give you here the tenor.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 NO man may enter the combat except he firſt ſhew a Favor from his Miſtreſs, which ſhe muſt publickly allow of.</item>
                  <item>2 If two Rivals fight, though either of them be hurt, no man may ſeperate them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Miſtreſſe command it, the reſt are parted by the Judges.</item>
                  <item>3 He that lets fall his Dart cannot take it up again but by his enemies leave, and a great many that will not ask it aſſault their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries with their Target.</item>
                  <item>4 Each carries the Arms of his houſe in his Target above, and his deviſe under, and his Ladies Picture in the middle.</item>
                  <item>5 The conquered are led priſoners before the Ladies from whom they crave two liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the one that they may be freed from the chains of Love, the other from thoſe that binde them.</item>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:56329:147"/>
                  <item>6 The Conquered gives up his Target to his Miſtreſſe, becauſe her Picturec is there pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Conqueror delivers his priſoners Dart to his.</item>
                  <item>7 If a Combatant fall, it is death to hurt him on the ground, and loſſe of honor to hurt him upon his knee.</item>
                  <item>8 The Combatant that findes himſelf ſtrongeſt muſt caſt his eyes upon the Knight of honor, who holds a Pennon, compos'd of all the Ladies Liveries; for if he lift it up, it is a ſign of grace, and that the Ladies will have the other weaker, no longer oppreſſed in their preſence.</item>
                  <item>9 That Lady, who hath had ten Victorious Lovers, which ſhe may verifie by her Darts, hath voice in the Ordinances of the Combat as the Judges have.</item>
               </list>
               <p>They obſerve likewiſe ſome others, but I found only theſe in the entertainments, at our Lovers ſolemnity, who were of all parts of the gallantry expreſt in honor of them, by the moſt expert Knights of the four Kingdoms I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; A great many other adventurers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves, as well of <hi>Baticalus,</hi> as other neighbour Provinces, who excellently acquitted themſelves, as well in the regulated exerciſes, as in the Combats of throng, where a thouſand Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions encountred with great skill and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:56329:148"/>
               <p>The Trumpets gave them encouragement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another, and nothing ſeen but a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing conſuſion, from whence the ſhouts on all ſides, in ſome ſort, equalled the pleaſure of the cars with that of the eye. The ſtrong had there the advantage, and in thoſe innocent Combats, the weak falling under the harmeleſſe blowe, gave the beholders greater joy than pitty.</p>
